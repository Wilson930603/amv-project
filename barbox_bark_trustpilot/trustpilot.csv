BEinFL,5,2022-07-04,My pup was the recipient of a BarkBox…,My pup was the recipient of a BarkBox for over 3 years. We both looked forward to seeing the toys and goodies custom packed for my little guy. The boxes are themed to seasonal items or holidays making the contents even cuter.

Jen,5,2022-11-22,Barkbox is an outstanding company,"Instead of spending a lot of money at a pet store for toys that wont last I spend less on barkbox. Easy to set up for durable enough toys, quality treats that are adjustable to food sensitivity and additional addons. My first box the toy was destroyed in less than 2 hours and I messaged them, they sent me a new more durable toy and helped me adjusted the durability level of our subscription, no problem. Awesome. I have been with them since then until I lost my pup. They canceled the subscription for me and offered a help-line if I needed someone to talk to, that was the sweetest thing to have offered. I just now received a wonderful email offering emotional assistance and tips to make it through the holiday season, it's good to have support. I have even more love for this company and how much they care. I wish I could give them more than the 5 stars.",2022-11-21,0
Megan & Tilly,5,2022-07-07,A Dinomite Box!,"I was thrilled to see the theme for the most recent barkbox, Jurassic Bark! Tilly adored all of the toys and eagerly ate her treats. The ""It's in my DNA"" ball has been a favourite to play with, bouncy and fun to chew! Tilly isn't as much as a toy destroyer as my last dog (I foster), so she is currently getting lots of fun out of chewing and squeaking the raptor hatchling, even though she hasn't torn it open. She gets a wonderful hop in her step whenever she plays with her barkbox toys, and I couldn't be happier with the June box.",2022-07-07,0

Bark Box solved that problem, maybe a little too well.  His toys last a long time now and I no longer need a monthly delivery of toys, so I discontinued the service.  Finn also loved the snacks and I felt they were high quality.  Maybe some different delivery options I think would be helpful like every other month for example.  I did feel the Bark Box staff were attentive & helpful, I just couldn’t justify continuing the service when we had developed a back log of toys.",2022-07-04,0

When she fell ill earlier and the year and we believed that her time with us was drawing short, Barkbox responded beyond all expectations with care and consideration.   Making a very difficult time that much easier.

My dog Archie and I have been Barkbox members for about six months now, and we couldn't be happier! A few months ago I reached out to the customer service team regarding the toys we were receiving (Archie is a super-duper chewer and has proven to me he can't have any toys with fabric or rope - he always swallows it). Every customer service rep I spoke with about modifying the toys in our BarkBox was incredibly kind, helpful, and accommodating; easily the greatest customer service I've ever experienced. For this reason alone, we will remain loyal customers! 

I love having treats and toys that Archie truly enjoys being at my door each month, all while requiring little to no work on my part.",2022-06-30,0

I received my replacement order quite quickly and my dog, Rolex loved them. 
I was also contacted by a team to change the details of my account so the box was better tailored to Rolex. I cannot believe how great the customer service is!

BRENDASTAR,5,2022-07-05,Customer Service,"I had a question about whether I received my BarkBox for this month or not, because I receive the BarkBox Survey before I receive the BarkBox.  The person I chatted with explained that the survey goes out the same time they start to pack the box.  This isn't the best time to send the survey, but it was an explanation.  Also, I wanted to know if I could get more treats and chew in the box.  The answer was no, only toys at this time, but again, I got explanations that I understood.",2022-07-05,0

Chris,5,2022-07-04,We’d certainly recommend Barkbox.…,"We’ve been very pleased with our Barkbox subscription. Our pup tends to destroy the store-bought toys we get her pretty quickly. The plush toys that have come in our Barkboxes have not only been both squeaky and crinkly (the two qualities she loves in a plush toy) but they’ve been remarkably durable. So durable, in fact, I wish we could get an “every-other-month” subscription rather than monthly because we’ve unintentionally begun stockpiling toys because the ones we’ve gotten are beloved & they last.
We did have one toy stop squeaking on the second day & I sent in a comment to Barkbox customer service. They immediately sent a replacement and graciously so.
The treats in the boxes are all natural and our dog has liked them all so far. But the toys are the stars. 
Finally, the company is very personal in their support. The customer service rep with whom we interacted said she’d love to see a pic of our dog, Daphne. We obligated. Later they sent us a hand drawing someone on their staff made of Daphne. A very nice gesture.
In any case, we’d certainly recommend Barkbox.",2022-07-04,0
Sofia Rodriguez,1,2023-06-21,"Satisfaction guarantee is a joke, do not buy","I had a Bark Bright subscription for 6 months. After one month, I wasn’t seeing results so switched from the tough chewer to the regular one. The tough chewer is given every other day while the regular is given every day, so I thought that might solve the problem. Support told me to give it a few months to see results, so I did. I cancel the subscription because I’m not totally happy, but because I’d signed up for a 6 month one, I had to keep receiving the boxes. I used it hoping that Support was right and it just took time. 5 months later, no results. I contact them back to get a refund according to their satisfaction guarantee, and they tell me I would only be eligible for a refund if I had canceled after a month. Really opaque and unfair to advertise a satisfaction guarantee then have support agents give customers the run around until the invisible timer runs out on their guarantee.",2023-06-20,0

I could almost tell everyone, they could tell by the Box that their toy and treat were inside.  I would split the toys and treats inside with each one.
I think the theme of the month idea was so incredible creative and the toys that went along with the toys were marvelous.   Everything was done so well, sent in a timely manner, and in a safe box.  I am divorcing my husband and can no longer afford these boxes, and have no dog of my own.  That is the reason I stopped my subscription.

LondonShopper,5,2022-09-17,Great !,"I signed up for a 6 month subscription, got a discount and freebie gift that we still use.  
The first box lasted 3 seconds because of my giant breed.  I emailed them and they just switched the contents to tough toys and snacks.  Brilliant.
The toys are all decent quality and so are the snacks.  The price is well worth it.
So it's just come to the end of my 6 months and we are in a strained financial situation, so I emailed them that I was leaving.  The refund was in my account within 30 MINUTES !!!! They did ask why i was leaving and if i was unhappy, but they didnt try and pressure at all.  I dealt with Kristina who was funny, kind and professional in her communication.  Their customer care is really unique, I love it.
Also remembered that we had delivery issue one month, it was with the courier and they lost it or something along those lines, emailed customer service and they sorted it all quickly.  No stress, their emails made me smile, I forgot I was annoyed.  
I will definitely be back to subscribe when we are able to.  Their customer service is always fresh and on point, their products are lovely, and the value is awesome.",2022-09-17,0

We have never had that issue with any other brand. Bark Box responded by making his subscription toys only, but we still had paid for plenty of unusable treats. We recently subscribed for the dental package with a free bed promotion. They were intentionally misleading, did not send the bed, and would not cancel the order even within the first day of placing the order. They were even going to charge me again for the next month if I did not mention a chargeback. Horrible service, and their products are very poor quality.",2023-01-13,1

Alex Heath,1,2023-03-20,Subscription Cancellations Mean Nothing,"I purchased a super chewer subscription, which was a waste of money. The toys and treats didn't last long enough to justify the money. To add insult to injury, I've not received a single box in more than a year, yet I'm still getting charged for a subscription I canceled immediately in 2021. I understand I was on the hook for a year, but I started my 12-month subscription in April 2021 and quickly figured out it wasn't what I'd hoped. So, two years later, I'm still being charged for boxes sent to a state where I no longer live. I moved in February 2022, I updated my address, and it didn't matter. So, I expected to miss two boxes, and that would be the end of the story. However, they've kept coming even though I had no active subscriptions to cancel. It's either gross negligence or an unethical tactic to retain revenue, and I'm not sure which is worse. In case I wasn't clear regarding the “value” of the super chewer box, it is a waste of money for the power chewers it targets.

Update: Since writing this, I discovered that an auto-renew feature exists. So it doesn't matter if you have no active subscriptions, they sneak in auto-renew and then hide it.",2023-03-18,0

Katherine McNair,2,2022-07-18,One year subscription and wishing I had picked 6mths,The boxes seem to be getting less and less treats and chew sticks but the payment is the same and always taken on the first of the month and shipping is getting later and later as the subscription goes on. For example July 2022 payment was taken automatically July 1st and as of July 18th only a shipping label has been created. When we got the first Bark Box in January we had payment and box delivered within a week of payment. The following month was the same and then by April it was about 8 days after payment and now we're at a little over two weeks after payment. Dog treats don't last until next box so we're having to buy treats in between the boxes. Where is the deal to continue the subscription? If you didn't have to lock in a amount of time when signing up I'd probably have already cancelled my subscription but I signed up for a year so I am waiting for December and hoping it gets better soon.,2022-07-18,1

I online chatted with FOUR different representatives during a span of two hours (I have screenshots to prove how much time was spent) and each one said that I could pick the first box WITH the cyber deal (have screenshots of that as well). 
End of story, I wasted two hours and they wouldn’t honor what I was told. None of this would have been a big deal had they just properly trained their employees on their specials (or asked a manager from the get go if they didn’t have the answer).

The reason I'm giving it a low rating is because the customer service is just... bizarre. Consistent unprofessional grammar mistakes littered the email, but that wasn't the main issue at all. They started out by saying it was ""very sad"" I wanted to cancel and ""to be honest,we have already priced the boxes and planned our inventory around those commitments"" so they wouldnt be letting me out of the subscription until 12 months were up. It was just this weirdly worded attempt at a guilt trip. They offered their Lite box at a lower price or pausing my subscription, which was helpful, but their earlier comments just left a bad taste in my mouth.

Don't get me wrong, the customer service was clearly trying to be friendly and not all companies can honestly say that about their staff. They just came across as so unprofessional that it's hard to trust how efficient and helpful they'd be if I ever had a problem. The problem I did (and still have, tbh) didn't really get resolved. It's my fault for signing up to a commitment before realising their prices are in a different currency. I'm just saying the customer service is... severely lacking.",2022-12-06,2

Lynn,2,2022-12-23,Company not worth investing a subscription,I set up an account for my little puppies and they took out two payments one for $32 and another for $27.99 I had to change my orders because I ordered the smaller one so I told them to cancel it they did not refund me the $27.99 I reported it to them they told me that they processed the payment on December 7th my bank never saw it and never received it even though they sent me an invoice which is a phony one because I showed my bank proof of it and they never seen it being posted. I called them again and I talked to the head lead supervisor and they said that the $27.99 did not go through to your bank due to a glitch in the system so they tried processing it again for $27.99 on the 20th I still have not seen it and the bank has not seen anything either so I called them again for the third time and they said that it's been processed on the 14th and I'm like whatever so I told him to cancel my account this company is a joke they tell you one thing they make you believe that you're going to get a refund if you cancel something and they think that you're going to get it but they never refund you it's a scam and though I got my first box ever they gave you five bags of treats and I only got two toys for my two dogs. I do not give my dogs store bought treats only healthy foods. Not worth the aggravation or investing in a subscription.

A Elizabeth,2,2022-10-18,Toys & customer service is good - fulfillment and shipping terrible,"I like the toys, but will stop spending a ton of additional money on seasonal add-ons from them. I have been a loyal subscriber since we got our new puppy 7 months ago. The first few months with Bark Box was amazing - usually got the box by the first or second week of the month. However, the boxes started getting sent later and later and then delayed further once shipped. 

They say on their site that all boxes ship the first or second week of the month... mine sure don't and their shipping partner Pitney Bowes is terrible. Last month, the box shipped super late the 3rd week of the month but then it sat in Indiana for a full week at their shipping partner so I got it at the very end of the month. I was ENSURED by their customer service rep (who was kind and great and all) last month that last months experience would NOT happen again. I'm sure there's copies of that transcript with them. Their customer service team is kind and nice, but don't assure me something won't happen again and immediately turn around and do it again. 

So, naively trusting that rep, I reinstated my subscription and ordered some Halloween add-ons with my October box. BUT... here we are again - in the 3rd week of the month and my Halloween toys will likely get here a couple of days before Halloween (if that...) instead of having a couple of weeks of play before the holiday has come and gone. I will hopefully see improvement in their fulfillment and shipping from them without the extra $40-60/month I was spending on add-ons in addition to the subscription cost or I won't be going back to spending the additional money with them... If I stay with them for the long haul at all depends on them being consistent with their shipping. My guess is that the company just hasn't scaled well to increased subscribers - the more customers they took on, the less consistent they got. Hopefully they can turn this around for those of us who keep giving more chances!!

Update on 10/20/22 post-response from Bark below: I saw the request for more info... Not sure what you mean by reference number though...I provided what I could. I think you have all the information to look at my account, pull previous chats with customer service, etc. You'll notice that November is the first box I won't be doing add-ons for and that I still don't have my October box. I am signed up for Bright as well, those boxes have been coming on time... So far. Hopefully they stay that way as that affiliate of Bark grows.",2022-10-09,0

3 days ago I check my PayPal account and it's been hit with a $193.00 charge. I have written back to them, quite a bit less polite this time. I've kept our correspondence for proof of cancellation, and I will file a fraud complaint with PayPal. Between BarkBox's Woke agenda with their gay dog toys (yes, gay themed toys for dogs) and their fraudulent billing, I'll never have any future dealings with and will caution my friends and family to beware of doing business with them as well.",2022-06-07,1

Bethany,1,2022-04-23,"Save your money, bark box has the absolute worst customer service","I’ve had bark box for two years during which time I have provided feedback to improve the experience and at each opportunity I was blatantly disregarded, insulted by team members as they implied I am a moron, and continued to have the same issues over and over again.  Specifically, bark box tells you to just let them know of any allergies your pup(s) have to tailor the box.  Well, I did and repeatedly received treats/ chews they are allergic to or, if not then main ingredient, listed in the ingredients of the treats/chews.   Of the few that they weren’t allergic to, my pups had no interest in the treats - That is really saying something because one of them literally tries to eat everything.   

In addition, when I discovered that they had a new allergy, bark box employees told me not to list the allergy because it would limit their ability to fulfill the subscription.   To be clear, my pups originally had an allergy to chicken listed about two years ago and then about a year ago, discovered they also have an allergy to pork.   So... we aren’t talking about pups with dozens of allergies, it was two and they didn’t believe they would be able to fulfill the subscription if more than one allergy was listed.   Needless to say, almost all of the treats/ chews, they cannot have.   

Bark box also asks for feedback on each box, on each of those I let them know my dogs did not like the treats/chews and it changed nothing.   Essentially, you waste your time filling in the information because they never read it and take it into account.   Speaking of not reading... I recently switched to toys only box after providing feedback for over a year that the treats/chews weren’t working for them.  A member from the bark box team reaches out without looking at my account or reading the feedback I had left about deciding to switch to toys only given their lack of change/ ability to accommodate my pups, and their team member essentially implies I am a moron unable of logging into my account and offers to switch me to a toys only box that I had already switched to....   When I respond that interacting with them when they fail to do their homework and thoroughly read feedback to be able to help, I am insulted again and ultimately my account closed without my permission or request to do so.  Given that I was ordering gifts for a family members’ dogs this one last time, I was beyond furious and the best the bark box team could do is send an email confirming that they hadn’t really bothered to read what I sent to them, just made assumptions and decided to close the account.   

Believe me, I absolutely am cancelling after all this nonsense, particularly given that my playful crew of 3 really aren’t all that interested in the toys either.   Given the choice of toys from the store vs. bark box toys, 9 out of 10 times they always choose the toys from the store.  If you are looking for long lasting toys, these aren’t the toys for your pup - many of the toys I have given to a family members’ pup and they typically last around 2 mins before being destroyed & discarded. There are a few more things you should be aware of if you are considering spending your money on  bark box... 

Not only is the customer service lousy, unwilling to read & act upon the feedback they are soliciting and they will insult you, if you decide to do any add ons be prepared for them to not be able to fulfill your order often because they oversold the item, for you to be charged at the end of the month but not receive the box for about 4 weeks later, for the treats/chews to contain ingredients that lead to yeast issues which in turn lead to skin issues for your pup, for repeating themes, and for your pups to not be interested in the toys you just spent a bunch of money on.  In retrospect, I wish I had cancelled after the first month but you live, you learn and you move forward & share the bad experiences you’ve had with this company so that others may determine for themselves if they want to send their money to them.   Good luck.",2022-04-23,1

Ann B,5,2022-04-01,These people are the best!,"Because I have a dog with cancer, about 3 months I had a question about extending my BarkBox subscription. As a result, it seems I’ve developed a bit of a relationship with the great people at Bark. A few weeks ago I was asked to fill out a survey and did so. I was then contacted by Lucy to go further into depth about my answers, which I did. Lucy was very kind and interested in Lulu. Lulu is a lover of all things treat and all things stuffie, though she has only once ripped up one, and that was 8 years ago when she was still a puppy, and it was, after all, made of leather, only a step up from beef. These once a month stuffies have lasted through shaking, being dragged through the mud, and the occasional trip through the washing machine and dryer. And the treats! She knows when the box is delivered and waits patiently for me to open it and whatever jerky chew she gets that I open first.
So, you can see that both Lulu and I love BarkBox and the people who work there. They truly have both of our best interests at heart.",2022-04-01,0

K. Sperg,5,2022-03-25,A serious blessing,"Barkbox has been an affordable way for me to provide interactive toys and treats for my dog. As someone who is immune compromised, it allows me the privilege to care for my pup without having to suit up and dive into a crowded pet store. My pitbull, Rosie, LOVES barkbox, the toys keep her entertained all month. Her favorite thing is pulling the squeakers out immediately, she's like a vicious unlicensed surgeon they way she finds them and dissects the toy, leaving the toy it's self largely intact with just a small hole where she extracted the squeaker. Entertainment at it's finest. I am incredibly grateful for them. I get to pamper my dog and have one less errand off my plate because the toys and treats come to us! Thank you so much for being wonderful!",2022-03-25,0

The toys are fun, imaginative, and well made they stand up to a thrashing. Each morning and evening Django picks 1,2 3 or more toys to bring to us to have a tug of war or a good chase.

He knows the box and we always tell him he got mail and he gets so excited. Barkbox will make your box anyway you want. We started off with just a regular box but he has a very sensitive tummy so they changed to toy only. Then we changed to tougher toys because he is a bulldog and can tear up everything. The toys now last. They also make the change and even when he got his box they sent more toys or tougher toys that same month. It is very much worth the expense. The toys are also so cute per holiday or season and also are a toy inside a toy. He loves to tear them up and when he gets the fabric off there is another toy inside. I can not say enough good things about them and if you like to spoil your baby get barkbox.,2022-03-25,0

In the 4.5 months we had Toby before Bogey passed away, knowing when Bark Box arrived was one of the things Bogey passed on to Toby!! Toby is now almost 11 months old, and he just gets so excited he can hardly stay in his skin until he gets a treat!! Truly funny to watch! The quality of toys is good, but there have been a few things Toby goes right through (we get the Super Chewer box), most likely to get to the toy inside the toy—which is always some type ball!

The stuffing can if passed to stomach or intestines cause a life threating issues due to blockages. Some of the dogs I've had could tear apart the toys to get the squeakers which can also be just as dangerous as the stuffing.,2022-03-22,0

Nancy T,4,2022-03-19,Tough chewers,"The people at Bark Box are fantastic. Unfortunately, a couple of the products I have been sent aren't up to the mighty chewers I have. My dog Floki immediately destroyed the raccoon looking tough chewer toy he originally got, and when you kindly sent a replacement my doodle destroyed the pink heart. I know there is no such thing as an indestructible toy, but I worry when they eat the stuff these are made of, they might become ill. When Willa ate part of the pink heart we got as replacement for the raccoon, she became sick. I took the toy away from her and of course she was broken hearted, but I did not want her to digest anymore of the toy. I think cloth toys are probably best for my dogs rather than hard plastic, although the green lizard toy is holding up well. The orange tire tube toy seems to be great for Floki. He loves it and it has not been eaten.

LetsTacoBoutIt,3,2022-03-21,Barking Neutral,Received first bark box fairly quickly which was overall exciting. Few of the toys were defective was able to get ahold of ambassador and they were willing to send out a replacement. Was pretty shocked and unhappy when received replacement toy as it was not a replacement of the defective toy instead they sent out a random toy to replace the defective toy. Reached out again to bark box and was informed the bark box toys for that theme were not replaceable with same toy as they don’t have extras which is odd. So all in all it was disappointing as pooch never got to have the ability to test out the featured toy or have fun with it.

Everyone is friendly and kind and go above and beyond to make sure your pet is happy. Emailed me to make sure I got it and was satisfied.

Libradog,4,2022-02-02,I absolutely love Bark Box!,"I absolutely love Bark Box. Although I think a way that you could make it even better and level up is depending on what the toy treat combination is offer people to pick out one toy one treat or if it’s an all toy box, like mine have them be able to pick out two toys and then you (Bark) choose two toys. We’ve been loyal members for years now and I’ve try to adjust my settings but inevitably she’s always liking two toys and not liking the other two, sometimes she doesn’t like three toys!  She’s very picky and she doesn’t like balls, she likes larger toys where I can hold and play tug-of-war. I’ve used the guarantee occasionally but I don’t like to overuse! I’ve tried to customize her box so she gets very few ball toys but that’s doesn’t work terrific! When I see what she could’ve gotten  I’m like, “oh I could’ve had a home run box for her”! I am sure you just have like three or four different boxes in combinations that you send out but I think that this would actually cut down on people doing the guarantee because they’re choosing!  For example this months  slumber party box she absolutely loved the pizza and she kind of liked the slipper but the other toys she didn’t touch!",2022-02-02,0

i just wish the balls for mid sized dogs where smaller as my dog is really not that big and has a hard time getting her mouth around the balls, for the catory her size falls into witch imo i think is large.
the balls i buy her from stores are 2 1/2 inch in size she can catch in air squeak if they have a squeaker and loves it.

AMY HARASTI,5,2022-02-02,Our Year of BARK,"Blue Andre-Fleury and I have had a monthly Bark Box for just over a year now. I don't know who is more excited when our new one arrives, but he definitely recognizes the box and tries to help with the opening. The toys and treats are exceptional quality, and I love the thought and detail that goes into each theme. We started with the Super Chewers as he was a busy puppy when we began, and it could not have been easier to switch to the Bark Box when it seemed extreme chewing was past. I've contacted customer service a few times with questions and when we discovered an allergy, and again just top notch. Kind, knowledgeable, efficient have been my experience. I normally recycle delivery boxes immediately, but I have trouble parting with the adorable themes in the boxes, so they have become the boxes I keep if I need sturdy storage or to send something lol.",2022-02-02,1

Unfortunately, there was one kind of treat Sadie didn't like. She took it and set it down. Very unusual for her. So, I contacted BarkBox to ask them not to include this type of treats in the next BarkBox.

To my big surprise, they went ahead and sent us a replacement. Thanks so much, BarkBox customer service. You really keep your promise and Scout's Honour.

Sadie and I are looking forward to the next BarkBox.

The treats and aren’t suited for Lucy’s age (5 months). We would rather be getting training size treats (1 to 4 kcal per treat). Treats provided are 8 to 22 kcal and don’t break cleanly into smaller pieces for training, which is really the main use of treats for a puppy Lucy’s age. In fact back of one treat even included a warning that they weren’t for dogs under 6 months!

Also the chew sticks last only about 10 minutes so they are really more like a large snack than a chew like a bully stick.",2022-01-26,0

All 4 and myself get excited when the boxes arrive and we open them together. And their customer service you ask??!? THE BEST!

So naturally I was worried because I signed up for a year of boxes, but I contacted customer service and they allowed me to switch him to a regular box (which he loves)!! They even sent him some replacement toys to last till his next months box came ( and I never asked for replacements!)

I was given a super chewer before we did the subscription and she loved it, and didn't destroy it. She was super excited when she got her first box. She loved all the toys and even my TM and Husky played with them which they typically aren't big on toys. I also liked that I was able to put all of my Malinois allergies in and they sent treats that were safe for her to eat. Each month there is an option to do add ons for her box. It can be extra toys, treats or even doggy clothing. Super excited for the rest of our subscription",2022-01-19,0

Lydia Price,5,2022-01-18,"Fun toys, great healthy treats and wonderful service","We just started our year old pup on monthly bark boxes this Jan.  The first bark box was fun and wonderful and our pup Tiffy loves the toys and treats we have already given her (saving some so she does not get them all at once).  I choose medium size for toys since she is just over the 20 pound low end of weight range recommended for Medium.  She is 22-23 pounds.  However, that size gives her a bit of difficulty making the squeakers work and she LOVES to squeak her toys when playing.  I knew I could change size, but could not figure out how to do it on my account.  So I talked to a rep on the chat line who was so friendly and helpful and did it for me.  Her next box will be small size.  The quality of toys and the fn and humor in them delights the puppy and her devoted humans.  Thank you",2022-01-18,0

M Burton,5,2022-01-13,Very impressed with their ability to customize the box just for Abby,"I was with BarkBox before but Abby destroyed all of the plush toys, so I switched to SuperChewer. I didn't like the hard toys and she would only play with the rubbery ones, but she didn't get many of those. I canceled while I tried to train her to be less destructive. My ""take and replace"" training with Abby worked and she rarely destroys toys anymore, so I signed up for BarkBox again. 

I was VERY pleased with the changes that have occurred. They now have a medium plush which is sturdier than the soft plush toys and you have more control over flavors for treats and chews. I got an email asking me about Abby's likes and dislikes and, in response to my answers, they marked her down for more ""toy inside a toy"" toys, more beef, no lamb or duck, etc. 

I could probably even ask them to give me 1 bag of hard treats and 1 bag of chewy treats because their customer service is so outstanding. Also they sent me a double box for her first box (4 treats, 2 chews, and 5 toys) and it included a free $40 dog bowl by Yeti. The toys were not the medium plush because that doesn't start until the 2nd month. That box shipped today so I'm looking forward to seeing the sturdier toys.

A big plus is that Abby gets so excited when her new box arrives. When it came in the mail, she was dancing! She remembered it from before and she knew what it was before I opened it. That alone was worth signing up for!",2022-01-13,0

I don't know what is different about BarkBox buy my dog LOVED his squeaker toys from BarkBox more than anything else I have ever bought him!  He proudly prances around with them and loves to hide them for himself only to ""find"" them later.  Our new BarkBox toys are my dog's preferred toys right now.  And he loves the treats!

Janet Holman,5,2022-01-12,Kodi Bear Fancy Pants Bite Bite,"Kodi Bear Fancy Pants Bite Bite, KBFPBB, got her first Bark Box before Christmas,  so the excitement isn't there yet for her.  However, mom & dad were excited enough for her and she soon joined in after seeing all the toys.  We had to coax her a bit to dive in as she's well trained to leave things alone that aren't hers, so she was somewhat confused.  Once she realized everything was hers she (we) had so much fun.  She of coarse luvs all the snacks and Bumble Ball was her favorite and ours too, especially on rainy days we can throw it in the house without damaging walls and furniture and she burns off some of her puppy energy.  
We are now anxiously waiting for her January Bark Box to see if she will be as excited as mom & dad.  Thank You Bark Box♥️🐾🐾♥️",2022-01-12,0

You guys really knocked it out of the park with the choices. My dogs loved everything and as a dog parent it was so nice to see them so happy with the toys and treats. Before, I would give them treats I would buy from the pet store and they were never this excited until I started this bark box service. At first I thought it was a little pricey, but seeing how happy it makes them, I feel like it was money well spent, every penny. Sorry for the run on sentences lol.",2022-01-12,0

We got the box the beginning of January and we were very excited to get it! Everything was Awesome all the toys and treats. We got the Rudolph the Red-Nosed reindeer original series box. 
The only reason why I'm giving the four star is because the limited items that you offer. It seems like the only thing you do offer are toys and treats. My dog isn't very big into toys, only once in a while. I feel that there should be more items to pick from including blankets, clothing, leashes, collars, stylish bowls, bow ties... ect!! ( Maybe during Christmas boxes or adoption/birthday boxes you could do some kind of craft item where the owner could make an ornament or something with their dogs paw print!? Or even partnering with Snapfish or a company where you could personalize the gifts for the boxes! 
BarkBox is a great idea but because of the limited amount of products you offer in the boxes I most likely will not continue the subscription after the 3 months because of this reason. I also could go online or into the stores and buy almost the same amount of treats and toys for the same price. I do however really like the fact that you personalize it to make it more special for my pet!!",2022-01-08,0

Usually after the first stage, the toy ends up in the trash.

Elaine Falconer,4,2022-01-01,First BarkBox was a success...,"I received my first BarkBox in December.  It was a double sized box with the Rudolph theme. The box was very well put together and had an adorable Rudolph insert that showed the different stuffed toys offered in this particular theme. It was colorful and well done. Of course that was more for me, what was inside the box was what my dog was interested in. My box contained 4 toys- a Bumble bouncing toy, Rudolph,  the polka dotted elephant and the Lion king of Misfit toys. All the toys looked very true to their characters in the movie and all made noise of some type. So far we have 3 left. We had to toss Rudolph after a few days as it had several holes from my dig playing with it. The box also contained treats-""Jingle Jerky"" in 3 varieties and 2 packages of sticks. The treats were packaged in the same theme, which was a fun touch. It looks like a lot of thought went into the box and I appreciated that. The Rudolph toy didn't last long, but my dog is enjoying the other toys. This was my first BarkBox; we purchased a 6 month plan for our dog for Christmas.  I look forward to seeing what is in the next box we receive!",2022-01-01,0

She picks a new one everyday.   It was super easy to switch from super chewer to regular bark box and they were very helpful when I was deciding what to do.   I even had to put the deliveries on hold for a couple of months and they understood and very kind during that as well.   Love the chat ability.  Prompt response.

She just wiggled all through the house with them, one at a time. She’s a pittie so you can just imagine how wiggly she was.  She even enjoyed the treats and she is a bit picky, so that’s a plus as well. 

I missed all of my claymation shows this year so these warmed my heart when I saw them. I’m going to try to get my fill of these shows all day today!

Jagger Johnson,5,2021-12-16,"Dear reader,","Dear reader,
The folks at Barkbox are fabulous!  Let me tell you why.  I sent a holiday box for my friend, Jagger, by way of his human, Phillip. Like a silly bird, I got the size of the sweater wrong. 

I reached out to the Barkbox team asking them to change the size for the next box.   

I didn't ask for a replacement, it was my mistakea after all. I was prepared to return the sweater and happily pay for the correct size. *They would have none of it*! They told me not to return it but to please find another pooch that it would fit or donate it to a local humane association. I did just that.  

With the sweater debacle buttoned up 😉 the rest of the box was full of delightfully appropriate and super yummy treats for Jagger. He barked thank you and gave the entire Barkbox a big paws up. 

Thank you Barkbox, for exceeding our expectations. 
Yours truly,
-Jagger, Bleuzette and of course, Phillip",2021-12-16,0
Bruce Arnold,5,2021-12-16,Lady’s first,"My daughter and her dog Luna have been with BarkBox for a while now. She has always spoken highly of your company. I was in the market for some new toys for Ladybug and thought about BarkBox. I created an account and placed an order. I was surprised to get a double box on my first order and thrilled about the discount for paying the six months a head.

The quality of the toys that arrived is top notch. Lady is hard on things and all of the toys are holding up well. The treats that came are a big hit.  She can be kind of picky but she has enjoyed everything that came in the first box.

I’m already looking forward to next month’s shipment and I feel confident that Ladybug is as well.

Not many companies would go this far above and beyond for their customers. I have received many emails checking to see if the order was up to my pups standards.

But toys aren’t all that comes in that box, treats!! Oh the treats!! They are the perfect size for our girls and they must taste pretty good because both dogs sit without even being told.(They get the treats faster that way because they are being good😉) 
Customer service has been beyond top notch!! Very responsive and do whatever they can to make your request a reality. 
The one thing I didn’t anticipate, or expect, was the girls’ reaction to the box. Since they received their barkbox, every box that gets delivered is thoroughly inspected, just in case!!

Yvonne Owen,5,2021-12-03,About 2 years ago,"About 2 years ago, I saw an ad for Bark Box. so I decided to try it. I had a female dog at the age of 12 and we had just got a rescue dog (male) at the approximate age of 2. our older dog loved balls and our new dog really didn't know what to do or expect. SO.... I ordered the Bark Box. Its great, We get 3 toys a month and 3 different kinds of nutritious, grain fee treats. Our male was so ecstatic about getting these toys, he no longer stole his sisters balls. Now we have another dog, she is 1 years old and loves to get the bark box, because her and her brother fight over the toys. Its really not a fight, more like, you have what I'm going to take. They play, play, play. And at the end of the day, they all have their own toy. I've been so happy with the quality of the products and service I have received from Bark Box, that I renewed my subscription. The place I purchase my dog food from told me they have dog play boxes available for purchase. And I told them, The quality of the toys from Bark Box are SO MUCH BETTER and their treats are ALL NATURAL. And the service you receive is great, My male ruined a toy within 10 minutes of playing with it and Bark Box, sent a replacement when I contacted them about it. Thank You Bark Box, for keeping my Babies happy.",2021-12-03,0

I've really only had great experiences with the company. With the exception of 1 toy one time, every toy has lasted a good amount of time and some I still have years later. My dog also loves the treats!

The one exception I had with the toy was something I want to mention though because I reached out to the customer support and let them know that my dog destroyed it on day one and I had the super chewer box so I was a bit upset. They made it right and sent a new box out with a toy that was more sturdy right away. 

I honestly rarely give 5 star reviews as most places are either over priced or just decent quality but BarkBox deserves it all around. From customer support to their social media pages to the quality of the toys and treats to the price of the packages, everything is just fantastic.

I've actually gotten 3 or 4 different friends to get this for their pups as well and they all agree with me.",2021-11-22,0

Huckleberry is a pitbull who plays tough with his toys. Usually he destroys everything but these are lasting so far! He especially loves the turkey Tom and the pea chew that came with his bed. The tougher the toy the better. Huck also has gluten/grain and corn allergies so we have a very tough time finding treats that are good for his sensitive tummy. I was glad to see there were options for pups with allergies. And the dog bed is a dream for him. He loves it so much, XL was the perfect size.

My dogs are 24 & 28 lb flat faced dogs and seem to be in the middle of small & medium size dog toys. Some of the small are just too small and some of the medium they can’t get in their mouths. Bark Box customer service have been so accommodating and helpful to make it work for me with each box I get. I have done 7 months of super chewer and am now switching to bark box. Even though my dogs are heavy chewers (and I know the toys won’t last as long) They love plush and I’m confident they will enjoy their new toys. I also buy the extra toy for $7 because you cannot find a quality toy for that price in the stores. Their customer service is A+ Prompt replies, super friendly and helpful. I will probably switch back to super chewer after a couple of months but it’s nice to know that is an option. The biggest bonus is how excited my dogs get when the box arrives!",2021-11-19,0

Bridget Sayles,5,2021-11-15,We love bark box!,"I have an Aussiedoodle. She’s a very smart dog. I’m not sure if she has the bark box logo memorized, or can smell things through the box. But when we go down to the mailroom in our apartment and get the bark box, she KNOWS it’s for her. Her tail starts wagging and her ears perk up, she starts sniffing the thing like crazy, she jumps for it as we walk back to the apartment. We hype it up too “look what you got! How exciting!”. The whole thing is just so fun. I always open the box and put it on the floor for her curious you see what toy she wants to play with first. This time she snatched the Turkey so fast and ran off to her spot on the rug she always goes to. She immediately flipped on her back and played with it upside down. This is her version of a “happy dance” I like to say. We love bark box. I may have to upgrade to the super chewer soon. Most toys she doesn’t completely destroy, but none of her bird toys have beaks anymore. Grandma’s pillow doesn’t have lace anymore. She destroyed the “joy” out of “cooking with joy” but is playing nicely with the book. That is still in one piece.",2021-11-15,0

Every month when the box arrived she took a picture of the box and all the great items that are included.  So when Riley joined our family we gifted the BarkBox.  Not only is the BarkBox great quality the customer service is outstanding!  Didn't realize they had a referral program when I ordered Riley's BarkBox.  Took a chance and emailed then after the fact and they immediately credited my daughter for an extra month for the referral.

As Jehovah’s Witnesses, we do not observe holidays. I spoke with several representatives for future boxes & they have graciously gave me a bonus box for December with the Space Jam theme. I was able to donate the holiday themed box to a local shelter. BarkBox even will ship the donated box directly to my chosen shelter. Talking about beyond excellent customer service!! I like the different methods to communicate with a representative as well. Text, email or via phone makes connecting relatively easy. I will have to  contact them each month if a specific theme does not interest me but if this process gets too tedious I’ll more than likely cancel the subscription (although I paid 6 months in advance) or not renew it. Hopefully we can meet at a compromise because my pups & I like the quality of the toys & treats & would like to continue our monthly subscription.",2021-11-13,0

I have/had two big dogs that I consider super chewers. Their individual boxes arrived and both dogs loved their treats and toys. There is no doubt that these toys will last and in fact, may be too tough for their older teeth. 

Here's where Bark shines above the rest:   I was able to adjust the strength/chewability to better suit the dogs' current chew strength. AND one of my dogs passed away before the next delivery arrived. Bark not only sent me condolences, they also have a dedicated grief contact. Because I had set up for six months for both of the dogs' boxes I was concerned that I'd still be getting two boxes. Bark allowed me to cancel my deceased dog's boxes.

Anonymous,2,2021-11-09,Barkbox is a disappointment,"Barkbox has been a continuing disappointment since the beginning. The super chewer box that I am subscribed to is designed for big dogs in mind only, my medium-sized, 30 pound, Red Heeler is a super chewer, but the toys are massive. You're locked into the subscription even if you cancel, they will continue to take your money. They require automatic payments and take your money at the beginning of the month, but I do not receive the box for weeks after they take my payment. I have had the service since May, just to clarify, I have given them a chance. You'll be asked what your pup prefers, but you won't get it most of the time, I have complained several times that my dog is not receiving the toys I asked and paid for, they will lie about it. I have proof. The only thing they have going for them is their customer service, for the most part, they will fix your problem, but you will still have to contact them each month and complain to get what you originally asked for. 
Barkbox could improve by:
1. Keeping in mind that ""super chewer"" does not automatically mean large breed dogs, the toys are ridiculously hard and huge. 
2. Give more options for boxes, customize toys for smaller breeds that are super chewers.  
3. Send your customers what they asked for. 
4. Send the box when you take their money. 
5. Let people cancel without being charged!",2021-11-09,1

I immediately received a response from BarkBox citing that they understand why I was looking to cancel and they could assist me even though they would hate to see us go. The truth is my dog and I really loved each BarkBox filled with surprises, but heading into the holidays it would be too much. This is when barkbox outlined several options that may fit our needs and still spoil Macklin, my dog. We could even pause for a few months, then start back up, or go every other month, we opted to go with BarkBox lite, one toy, one treat, but still keep the monthly routine.

I completed the profile for my lab, who is of course a heavy chewer, and received the fluff box 4 times before realizing it wasn’t the correct box. If you try and make changes they try and extend your contract and then try and add $$ to your monthly payment to correct their mistake. After 30 mins of messaging, and asking for someone to actually call me they switched the remaining boxes to what I originally signed up for. I ask them to make sure my account didn’t auto renew and I got the run around about that too. My dog loves it, me, not so much. It’s cheaper just to buy a Kong every month when you buy dog food.",2021-11-03,0

My picky 15yr old shorthair loves them!
I will say, this is my second time with barkbox and their customer service is fantastic! The first time I ordered I ordered the super chewer cause one of my dogs is a shredder/destroyer. I didn’t realize the toys would be more plastic. When I contacted customer service to see if I could get one plush and one super chewer so my older dog (who loves plush toys) would have a toy they were very accommodating and said that wouldn’t be a problem! They truly are a customer oriented company and aside from my dog loving the boxes the previous subscription the experience with their customer service definitely factored into my decision in going back!",2021-11-03,0

Our doggie was given to us, Baxter was one step away from the pound. So my family with the heart of Texas took him in. Mind you, I truly didn't want a dog. I mean i really really didn't want him. But he has grown on me and now he's my boy. Now we decided he needs a friend, my husband knew a lady who was giving her dog away she lived in an apartment and was never home and felt is was unfair to him. So ME (the one who didn't want dogs) insist we take him! so next week we will have Kiko-poo! 
Baxter loves his boxes and we both get so excited to see his new toys! Honestly some of the treats he doesn't warm up to. But that's okay, my neighbor has a doggie and she loves them. LOL

Before we subscribed to bark box our terrier would hog all of the toys and her brother, our cocker, would rarely get to join in on the fun. For some reason the bark box has solved this and our cocker gets to claim his own favorite toys and decide which ones to demolish instantly and which ones to enjoy for a few months. The cookies and chews are in compliance with his delicate dietary needs and he shares them with his sister eagerly. While us humans think the themes are often quite stupid and wouldn’t mind some of the toys being a tad more durable, the furkids don’t care and just cherish their monthly box of goodies….and if all of the toys are chosen for immediate destruction they know they get another box full of surprises in apx 4 weeks….and mom and dad are never upset if a toy meets its demise in what they deem to be an untimely manner.",2021-10-31,0

My pup was excited to receive his first super chewer bark box!  I have previously been gifted a bark box a few years ago and completely unsatisfied with it.  I was curious when I found the super chewer box.  I decided to try it and am pleased to say this time around has been more on the positive side.  The toys are awesome! Even my boys played with them prior to giving them to our dog, LOL.  There was only 1 treat bag my pup seemed to not care too much for.  I had contacted customer service for an unrelated issue, was asked for my feedback on the box.  I informed the agent that if I had to find something wrong with my order the only thing I could think of was this.  I was informed that they could send out a replacement order for that bag of treats in a different flavor.  I agreed and currently awaiting the replacement.  I was very happy to have such a positive experience this time around.  We look forward to more bark boxes in the future.",2021-10-29,0

Tiffany,5,2021-10-22,My skepticism has been destroyed just like every toy that came before Bark Box,"I have a 1 year old Lab mix that can destroy  any toy in a matter of minutes. I've been looking at Bark Box Super Chewer for a while, but couldn't justify it since I just knew the toys wouldn't last. Fast forward to a free bed promo they ran right after Kylo the destroyer tore up a bed and I finally gave in (free gifts are my fave). We get our first box soon after I ordered and we are all blown away. Thr nylon toy inside is still holding on and he loves it. There was a 2nd toy that has a fluffy outer lay that is meant to be torn to shreds only to reveal a whole new awesome texture inside... like a whole new toy! Genius. The treats are also high quality and loved by both my dogs (Sampson is a 13 year old border collie with completely different tastes than the puppy). Soon after the box, the free bed arrived. This is not just some flimsy dog bed give away. Its an XL cooling memory foam luxury bed that came with a free stuffed toy pea. 3 days later and the little toy is still in one piece. No stuffed toy has ever lasted more than 30 min and he's been playing hard with it. All dog toys should be made like this!
We are so happy to have started our subscription... which in the end is less money monthly than I was spending on toys and treats that were gone basically on the same day of purchase. 
Don't drag your feet like I did if you have an active toy destroyer. This is so totally worth it!!!",2021-10-22,0

My younger pup has spent hours every day (no exaggeration) romping with the crinkle toys, and is regularly nudging us play tug o'war with the pumpkin toy or to throw a plush crinkle egg again. They have held up well to her full puppy enthusiasm so far, outliving many a plush dog toy before them.",2021-10-20,0

Part of the joy was seeing her open her box and pull the first toy out, the HOLY MACKEREL. However the SLOBBER BOBBER has become her fast favorite. We decided to do Bark Box after a recommendation from a fellow pet store shopper that, like us, was dismayed by the lack of solid toy offerings in the stores. Skunked three times in a row. There was so much in the box, both toys and treats, we were able to generously share with our adult daughters dog Björn, a giant breed mix (171 pounds).
We are all very happy with this investment and look forward to the 11 months to come.

She loved it because it was an easy rip and the surprise toy was a durable purple bunny that was scented— which is always great! The Nylabone that was in the shape of a heart was not one of her favorites. She has plenty other nylabones but they’re in the shape of a bone so I just think she thinks she isn’t allowed to chew on it… it may be well for other pups, but mine doesn’t like it.

The treats inside were very nice and we are able to use one bag of the very tender lamb bits, but the rest , again is for a medium breed dog that is 4 months and up.  I was a little disappointed for my pup, but this is an excellent box for older puppies! Lots of goodies and toys and such a beautiful theme. I did have to go out and purchase teethers and crinkle toys that were light enough for him and more to his size and passed on the bark box to my daughter whom has a 4 months old German Shepard and he loved all the toys and snacks so it wasn’t a waste .

So I have changed from fluffy to the more sturdy toys. 
The box is so colorful and fun. She listens intently as we read each detail to her. She loves the treats and will jump up and down like popcorn while we get the box out for a treat. She’s already asking if she’s going to get another one!

After a few boxes, my pups know exactly what is in store and we share the excitement.The ability to add additional themed items makes trips to the pet store a thing of the past. Sometimes I wonder if they are aimed towards the dogs or the owners (looking at you April “special” theme!) If I have one thing I would love to see improved, it’s the shipping time.

Brandy Heberle,5,2021-10-01,How much my family loves Bark Box!!,My fur baby Gizmo and my spouse and I love getting his bark box every month. He enjoys the toys and treats he gets. I also love how we can track our box through the app and they keep what is in the box a secret until it arrives. When it arrives you can rate the toys on how tough they were to how perfect they were for your fur baby. We started off with the regular box but then upgrade it so we could get a few more toys and treats for Gizmo. Bark box is cheaper then going to a pet store and having Gizmo pick his own toys out because no matter the size of the toy at the pet store it’s always an arm and a leg. With bark box you get more than one toy and more treats for the same price as two toys at a pet store. We would recommend Bark Box to anyone and we would give it a 10/10 review.,2021-10-01,0

When I looked up Barkbox online I was so impressed with the cost. After buying one single toy, I knew this was a great deal. Links first Barkbox blew our mind. We upgraded him to the super chewer box. He literally has a bin of toys he has not killed. I don’t have to hit the pet store as often as I was. We get treats, chews sticks, and toys. Two of each!!!!! Completely worth the cost. I honestly tell everyone I know who has a dog to get one.",2021-10-01,0

Jon Francis,5,2021-09-22,Amazing customer service,Amazing customer service! I have been a customer of Bark box for several months. Captain O’Malley and I love the boxes so we decided to start getting the super chewer boxes as well. I unfortunately did not pay close enough attention that the boxes included nylon toys. Captain O’Malley has issues with his gums and nylon toys seem to aggravate the situation. I contacted Bark to see if it would be possible to have only rubber toys in the boxes. They tailored his box per my request but because the request would not take effect until November they sent him a replacement for the October’s box. This is above and beyond especially since the error was solely mine! Truly an amazing company and product.,2021-09-22,0

The chews were soft and didn't last long, but my dog loved them and he is a very picky eater and is not food driven at all!   But the 2 toys were very hard nylon and Boozer showed no interest in them.  I don't think he even knew what to do with them. I  read that Bark had a 100% gguarantee so I emailed them.  Even though it was Sunday night on a holiday weekend I  got a response within a few hours!  The message was extremely nice and very apologetic.  The person went out of her way to learn about my dog and his likes and dislikes to make sure he would love everything in future boxes.  This person also made sure he would get a replacement on the 2 nylon toys he didn't like. She was very concerned.

Sarah,5,2021-09-09,"Great Variety, Happy Doggo!","Barkbox has been so helpful! I have an AmStaff/Coonhound mix, and he is perfectly content to just chew something for hours; until it is completely ruined. We were going through toys like crazy before we found BarkBox's Super Chewer edition. We have been getting these boxes for a year, and we will definitely be continuing. The variety of toys is awesome! A lot of them are solid nylon that he can't chew through, and some of them have a layer of material that he gets to destroy so he can get to the hard rubber toy inside. He still gets to chew and destroy things, but for much cheaper than we were before! For reference, my 50-pound dog has destroyed multiple XL Kong toys (usually the same day we give them to him), but we still have some of the nylon toys from the very first box we received a year ago. I have only had to reach out to customer service once to ask questions about an item (no issues, just a curiosity) and they were able to immediately respond with a personalized answer. I also love the ""rate my box"" feature! After the delivery of each box, I get to rate each item on a scale of 1-10, and leave a comment explaining my answer. More than once, customer service has reached out to me when I mentioned a toy didn't hold up to the chewing for very long to offer a replacement. They have tailored the box we get to include some of my dog's favorite types of toys and flavors. All I had to do is mention that my dog didn't like the duck flavored treats, and they immediately reached out to let me know that they had updated my box preferences to include no duck in the future. My dog loves BarkBox for the toys and the treats (huge variety of those as well) and I honestly love everything about this company.",2021-09-09,0

MEROLLERED,5,2021-09-02,"Amazing company, best decision I've made with keeping the sub box","Been a Bark Box subscriber nearly the entire time I've had my boy. The toys are a bit weak against his destructive behavior (ALL toys, are so don't judge Bark Box badly on that. He even destroys the ""lifetime warranty"" and ""indestructible"" toys) but he doesn't like rubber toys and we don't like them either (he tends to drop them on our head or throw them at us when we aren't paying adequate attention to his highness). But the themes are amazing, the box options is awesome too. We get the toy only box with 1 extra toy and we ALWAYS do add on's because we found that if we overload the pupper with toys he destroys them at a slower rate (lol, oh he OWNS us doesn't he?!?!?!) but I am always sad when a toy meets the ""toy grave yard"" because they are fun and cleverly designed toys that were fun to play with while they lasted. 

The company itself has been great, any time I've had to contact them about changing plans about or whatnot it has always been super easy and fun because we are able to share photos and stories back and forth of each other's puppers and tell amusing but relatable stories of our loved ones.",2021-09-02,0

My puppy is obsessed with “unwrapping” his new barkbox toys, and it  keeps him distracted from other destructive habits so I’m all for it! Some of the plush toys do leave a little bit of fuzz around if you have a destroyer like my pup, but it tends to clump up and it’s super easy to pick up in the wake of destruction. We also live with an older dog who loves the toys and treats just as much, but he’s a lot gentler on them. I honestly can’t say enough good things about Barkbox, I’m super impressed with their attention to detail and their love of pets really shows.",2021-08-27,0

The toys are unique to Bark, the treats are all exlusive Bark freshly crafted and better prices for what you get. You can barely buy one small toy and a bag of commercial junk treats at the store for $23!

I can't always get to a store to get new toys and treats.  Bark Box kept showing up in different internet feeds.  I gave in and took a look. I started an order and then didn't place it.  Then playing one morning before work I thought I should just place that order.  So, I did.  When the box arrived we weren't home so when we got home I took Oliver out because it was his package.  We brought it in and he could have cared less as I opened the box.  I sat the open box on the floor infront of him and he started to nose through it.  He got really excited and started pulling the toys out and running through the house with them! I let him pick one bag of treats to open and he picked Moo pies first.  We just finished those and he loved them and he knew what bag they were!  We started another bag and he is just as happy with them!  He still is playing with all his toys.

They immediately said they would send us two more toys and did I want tougher toys? I told them replacements would not be necessary as this was an isolated case for the time I had been subscribing. But they sent them because they truly stand behind their products.  Bark Box has, by far, the best (and friendliest) customer service I have encountered in a long time.

On a separate note, we have a severe peanut allergy in the house. When I contacted them about it they not only made certain we would never receive any treats with peanuts but also added a place for new subscribers to specify any allergens that needed to be eliminated from the monthly boxes (Bark Box substitutes non-allergen treats).",2021-08-09,0

I am seriously considering going back to the original Bark Box instead of the super chewer. However the toys won’t last. A suggestion would be to mix it up a bit for these breeds and others that chew but can rip a toy and pull the stuffing out in 3 minutes.,2021-08-08,0

Jessica Pollock,5,2021-08-08,Great Experience,"My personal experience with Barkbox has been absolutely wonderful. I started my subscription a few months ago; a little while after adopting our fur baby, A German Shepherd Siberian Huskey Mix that we named Scar. Scar is not just a pet for us, he has literally become a part of our family and we try very hard to make sure that he is in the best health both physically and mentally. Recently, our precious pup became ill with some stomach and potty issues (to refrain from too much information) and our vet made some suggestions to stop giving him treats as they made have played a part in making him not feel well, along with changing his diet and prescribing him some medication. At first I was saddened because he really enjoys his monthly Barkbox which is where we get his treats, he just seems to know that I'm bringing ""His"" box into the house, but I was relieved to see that there was a toys only option that would allow him to keep getting his monthly surprise. Therefore, I simply switched to this option for now and explained why I made the switch in the comment section of his box review for the month. I didn't think anymore on it honestly, however within days I received a really nice email from Barkbox showing concern for my pup. Although I do not believe their treats were the sole cause of his troubles, I did answer all their questions just in case and they have continually reach out to me during his time of sickness - even sent him a get well toy for his troubles. It was really heart warming and touching that this company took the time to do that, especially considering the amount of customers they have and the amount of emails they probably receive on a daily basis. This may seem like a small issue to some, but as new puppy owner's this was our first experience with illness in our puppy and we were really concerned so it was nice to have someone continually reach out to me during this time of worry.",2021-08-08,0

Dan,5,2021-08-04,I love barkbox,"I love barkbox! It's such a great way to spoil your pets and save money. I have 6 dogs and one box with the addition of one extra toy per month is enough toys and treats for us for the month. I save money by not needing to buy treats or toys from pet stores. And if my dog destroys a toy, fine by me! You can always contact them and have it replaced, but I've got such a large collection of the toys for the dogs now that having one meet it's maker isn't the end of the world. Plus, I know another three are coming. 

I seriously love this company and I love their products. They've only gotten better in their customer support and selections. They always have deals running for little extra goodies. If you're on the fence, try them. They're fantastic.",2021-08-04,0

Kymberlie Specht,5,2021-07-29,SuperChewer review,"I received my first box for my dog in July.  My Ryan is still a puppy and is a heavy chewer,  this toys hold up and are very durable.  I'm impressed ! He's a large breed puppy and gets quite playful with the toys. I do a toy only because Ryan has a sensitive stomach and I only buy him a select few brands of treats. I called customer service because they sent me a regular box with treats. They sent out an extra toy and apologized for the confusion.  I donated the treats though. Customer service is good and very consistent. I would recommend this to anyone with heavy chewers!",2021-07-29,0

Also if I didn't know any better every ""free"" item promotion deal that was offered and I would have clicked claim that would have been bad because I believe you give that item for ""free"" but with a cost of a subscription or am I wrong?

Cotton and Hershey both have beds on the floor at the foot of my bed and they pick a toy to cuddle and sleep with.  Before bedtime, they get 2 treats apiece which satisfies them and puts both in a bedtime mode.

I could not have asked for a better purchase anywhere to keep my pups happy and entertained.

Cotton and Hershey gives BarkBox 2 paws up and I give you a round of applause for such a great purchase.

Brooke Miller,5,2021-07-14,BarkBox is the BEST,"I signed up for BarkBox about a year ago and the sign up process is super easy, not to mention you are given a free toy and lots of good deals as a first time subscriber. There is a HUGE variety of box types to choose from. You are bound to find one that is perfect for your dog. The treats and chews are very high quality and BarkBox is constantly improving their recipes. You can choose which flavor of treats are right for your dog as well. The best part of the box is obviously the toys. BarkBox is so creative and fun with their toys. I think I get more excited than my dogs to see the toys every month. On top of all that, their toys are great quality and last so long. My dachshunds love to destroy toys, and these have lasted the longest by far. I had BarkBox's Super Chewer subscription for awhile, which was also amazing quality. Every month there is the standard toys you receive, but you can also add on extra toys. My dogs receive two plush toys and treats. But, I also like them to have some chew toys, so I add on a nylon chew toy here and there. The customizability of BarkBox is amazing and they truly care about their customers. Any issue I've ever had (even if it wasn't their fault) has been taken care of above and beyond. I am more than happy with my experience with BarkBox and love getting high quality toys and treats every month, rather than buying them at the pet store. If you are on the fence about trying BarkBox, you will not be disappointed. Your dogs will thank you.",2021-07-14,0

Pretty sure my settings were turned off for auto renewal but i think the company set it back to auto when i was given a free one month extension box for a shipment blunder. Now i’m stuck for another 6 months. My dog gets the super duper chewer box and has received duplicate items and accidental rubber toys. Barkbox is pretty good about fixing these mistakes. It’s not a great fit for us though since the only toys he can have are the nylon. He now has a basket of 11 nylon toys that don’t interest him. Sure wish that auto-renewal didn’t happen. Now we’ll have six months more of nylon toys that no one needs! Pretty bummed about that.",2021-07-12,0

The customer service is great always polite and helpful and the items are good but I feel like at this point I have more complaints than I do positives.  I order my first bark box after hearing a friends story of how much her and her dog love it.  I planned it out perfectly everything was going to be perfect.  I ordered it in time that it would get here just as I got my puppy and sadly that is not what happened,  between it sitting in the packing stage for a week to fedex failing to move and deliver it on time it came way past the date, I reached out to customer service about how upset I was with the tracking and packing process and they assured me it would be better next time and send out a replacement which then sat in packing stage for I wish I was kidding over two weeks! That’s super uncalled for, now they don’t know when it will arrive because the ever so awful fedex can’t provided a location or really anything.  I don’t think it’s too much to ask to ship and deliver in a timely manner so that me and my pup can get excited about new toys and treats.

I thought about renewing until I read about the issue they were having with the duck dog treats and how they were making dogs sick and killing some. I threw away all the duck treats I had from them
And decided not to renew it. Well to my shock I had a $149 pending charge on my cc and when I contacted them they said they would refund. Well they only refunded me $124. You can’t talk to anyone or even get them to respond to their messages. I am now disputing it with my cc company and writing this review. Be careful with this company. Customer service is awful!

DogMomma,1,2021-06-08,Barkbox renews UNAUTHORIZED charges!,"I already have history that Barkbox LOVES to renew the subscription and refuses refunds at all costs.  

However, I had no idea what to get my mother for Christmas.  I decided Barkbox, but I had everything figured out not to be charged an unauthorized subscription.  I got her 6 month subscription.  I bought a giftcard with $150.   So when they TRIED to renew, there would be no money for them.  

I get an email at my work saying they couldn't charge me and they needed updated info.  Two days later I get an email to my personal email from paypal saying it was charged! WTH!!!!  I went to paypal and have no subscriptions allowed.  How could this happen?  

I file a complaint with Paypal.  They said it was authorized.  No it wasn't!  I go to barkbox with my personal email.  I hadn't seen my work email at this point.  After 72 hours of no response, I email again.  I finally get a response that the account under my personal email hasn't been used since 2019 and so they don't understand my dispute.  

I get to work and see the work email.  I respond to her and am waiting for a response.  

I go to barkbox and try to login with my work email to see if I had the subscription box renewed.  (I immediately canceled it in December)  Wow!  It shows no account with my work email.  Did they just delete it?  Now I am getting nowhere!  
Thanks for stealing $149.55 that I thought I had done everything in my power to stop your being a thief.  

I am disappointed in paypal.  The email for my paypal and barkbox do not match and you allowed the payment anyway.  Why was an email not sent saying is this charge authorized?  And paypal was quick to say is was an authorized charge.  Once they say it was authorized, I am not able to dispute again.  


WHAT A CROCK!  I WILL NEVER USE BARKBOX AGAIN! And I am deleting my paypal.  They are the 3rd party that is suppose to stop this kind of crap and they are part of it.

Update: After the 5th back and forth email, they asked why I wanted to cancel.  I was so frustrated. I had stated in the previous email.  At this point, I asked if they were stalling to refund my money. I demanded a refund by close of business or stated I would be speaking to my bank and FTC or whatever agency would hear my complaint. I had a 5 month refund within the hour.",2021-06-08,0

Customer service is great, put us on hold for over an hour several times, were told it was canceled and later find a bill of a new non canceled box. 

We are now going straight to the bank and doing charge back so we do not get scammed any longer.  

This seems to be the tactic of every mystery box. Auto renewal, not clear on how to cancel or if it was canceled, and of course shoddy customer service.",2021-06-08,0

Called them to clarify the allergies, still got horrible treats. Used their online support chat option TWICE and still got horrible treats. All of the toys are useless - I literally got the same toys in like 3 boxes because they had too many of them on hand. AND their gimmick to get you to sign on with a special box is not true. They’ll send you whatever they have and when I reached out asking about the EXTRA I paid in order to get the space box they said “sorry. We have maybe one toy from that box. Too bad” and instead of refunds or apologies they tell you to donate any toys or treats your dog can’t use - Money is exchanged for goods and services and I get NEITHER if I’m donating everything I paid for?? And on top of that, they know their business is so despicable that they WILL NOT ALLOW you to cancel your subscription. I bought a year package for nearly $400 just before the pandemic hit and I’m forever disgusted in this company and how they handle business. I will absolutely be spreading the word as far as humanly possible to ensure no one else suffers like my family did having lost $400 before the pandemic and watching chunks of plastic scented like vanilla arrive in a monthly box next to treats that could kill my animals.

barkbox customer service has reached out but it's just a smoke screen. They sent a long message saying how sorry they are and will offer 1 free month to make up for every month getting later and later. The company that once cared about the customer is gone and being replaced with a company that is only purpose is to make money for the stockholders and screw the customer's. 

Plus once their motto was that all the dog treats were made in the USA has changed now and being made in other countries. 

The subscription service has been getting worse each month. The subscription boxes are getting shipped later and later each month. My April box is just to arrive on the 29th one day before the end of the month. Since December the shipping speed is getting worse and worse. What's the point of having a monthly theme box for to only arrive at the end of the month. I tried customer service and they told me that my barkbox was shipped and received in the time limit on my account. For anyone who is thinking about getting the subscription service might want to rethink their decision.",2021-04-23,0

Every month they ""say"" my box has shipped and 14 days later it is still at a partner facility. They blame COVID. Load of crap.

Mary Anderson,4,2021-04-30,Ughh...,"I've  only signed up for a six month subscription.  Thank goodness!  I am very disappointed in the shipping of this box.  They keep coming later  and later.  It is now April 29th and we still haven't received our April box but they made sure they received payment a month ago.  We signed up for the super chewer box.  The toys in the March box were like rocks.  My pup played with them for all of one minute.  The toys in that box were a big waste of money.

Lorelay,1,2021-05-01,Our April box arrived in May and was not worth the wait,"Our April box arrived in May, the theme isn't even cool, I got 2 zombie squirrels and a dinosaur; apparently the ""best of barkbox"". 

I'm disappointed that themes like Bud hounds is reserved as a promo for new subscribers or as ADD ONS THAT CURRENT SUBSCRIBERS HAVE TO BUY SEPARATELY. I thought the point of getting a subscription was to be able to get the cool toys every month, not get surplus or reject toys. We should all be part of the fun!

I would not have purchased a subscription knowing that the amazing novelty toys were not part of the package. It feel misled.

[edit] I talked to customer service and they offered to send me a different old theme. That's a nice gesture but my feedback remains the same: let us subscribers opt into the cool themes pls don't make us buy them as add ons...",2021-05-01,0

Jessie Garner,5,2021-02-27,Fantastic Experience for Both Big and Small Dogs,"We have two dogs—Graham, a 2-year-old, 80 pound Goldendoodle, and Sparky, an 11-week-old, 5 pound Shih-Poo. This is the first box we have ever received, and I am so excited to say that my Super Chewer subscription is worth every penny!

My Goldendoodle, Graham,  is the definition of a Super Chewer! Plush toys are no match for his strong jaw. I have never seen him sit and work at a toy for longer than 15 minutes. Rubber toys don’t stimulate his brain as they should and plush toys are nothing but loose threads and fluff in under 10 minutes—even the ones marketed and sold as most durable! He and his little brother, Sparky, have been playing with the Hardcore toys nonstop for 3 hours now. I am so happy to see them happy. The best part is that once they’re done with the shredding (which he loves), they will have a durable rubber toy that dispenses treats like peanut butter. 

Graham and Sparky are also in LOVE with the nylon chew! I can tell because neither of them are typically a fans of the rubber toys that have no fabric, but they have been gnawing at this toy for a while now. The nylon makes a difference because it offers enrichment that the toughest rubber can’t. Thank you, Bark Box! 

Both Graham and Sparky love the bagged treats! They’re easy to break off into smaller bites for training. I am always wary of treats, snacks, and food that my dogs ingest. The ingredients in this chew makes me feel safe and confident that my dog is receiving a healthy snack! 

It means so much to know that the toys and snacks have been so carefully designed with dogs in mind. You have definitely done your research and found that these items are great for both dogs’ health and enrichment. Thank you, thank you, thank you, Bark Box, for all you did to make this a fantastic first experience!",2021-02-27,0

Karla Kenyon,1,2021-03-06,Totally Messed Up And No End In Sight,"This is my third negative review on the same unending problem.  I tried to transfer the last three boxes of my subscription to a dog rescue.  I followed their directions to change the email and mailing address, but that caused me to be locked out of my account.  The rescue people subsequently rec’d an email message saying that the March box was going to be shipped to my address instead of theirs.  Every time I contacted BB to try and straighten this out, I got a different rep who had no idea what was going on.  Finally, after giving a bad review on this site, a “Team Leader” named ‘Sarah and her dog Grim’ contacted me.  She was extremely nice and seemed helpful...even said she was adding an extra box to my subscription as a courtesy.  She said the mailing address was now corrected and that I could again get into my account by using the rescue’s email.  Great.  Except it turned out to be just talk.  Neither myself nor the rescue got a  March BarkBox and I still can’t deal with it because I am still locked out of the account. I am so frustrated I could scream. I’d just walk away, but the money I paid for these three ‘extra stuffed’ boxes is no small sum. This company is so disorganized and inept that even when some rep tries to straighten out a problem the solution ends up being thwarted by somebody else in the company.  At this point I’m beginning to consider checking with my credit card to try to get a refund and be done with this months’ long hassle. I’m finding it hard to believe that a simple change of address could possibly be this difficult to manage, and I’m starting to wonder if this isn’t, in reality, a ploy to get me to give up trying so they can scam me out of $90.",2021-03-06,0

Sydney Via,5,2021-04-15,Disappointed,"I originally ordered barkbox in November 2020 for my Rottweiler. The first box we got he destroyed the toys in a matter of minutes. When I was asked to rate it I mentioned that we weren't happy with the durability of the toys. A representative contacted me and said that they would send a extra toy that came from the super chewer line for rocko to test and if he liked it I could pay the extra fee every month, I was impressed that they wanted to fix it that quick and easy. Instead what happened was no extra toy and when I looked into my subscription they just started charging me the extra fee. I once again reached out only to be told that they wouldn't honor what I was told by email that I had to pay for it so I canceled my subscription. But today I saw the April box and loved it so I signed up again only to be told that a family member had ready gotten rocko a subscription for his birthday. When I reached out to cancel said subscription (I dont think he needed 2) I've been told I can not cancel it and that I have to pay for this month's bc SKUs have ready been made in the 2 hours of me signing up. I will never suggest yall to friends or family. This company has been a disappointment both times I've tried to give my business. 

The only positive thing I can think of is at least they paid attention to the allergies he has and didn't send anything chicken or beef. He loved the treats sent in his X-mas box.

***UPDATE***
I just want to say thank you to Evan from Bark leadership for reaching out to me! He was really helpful and heard me completely out on our families experiences with Bark. He spent 30+ minutes on the phone talking to me about everything that happened and is even sending Rocko the super chewer toy he didnt get back in December. He has really made me feel like even though my experience wasn't the best in the beginning that this company would do their customers right and always try to fix the problem. Because of his excellent customer service and his true sincerity in wanting to hear me out to see how he could help in fixing our experience I'm changing my rating from 1 star to 5 stars.",2021-04-15,0
Sarah Rotter,5,2021-04-16,AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE! THANK YOU EVAN!!,"Samson's box was just delivered and I have to say that I'm highly disappointed. This is now the 2nd year in a row that he's received a completely lame theme for his April box instead a 4/20 themed box! I signed him up last April because of the promotion for a 4/20 themed box which I never received, but kept his subscription in hopes that he'd get one this year seeing as how they’re just handing them out to new customers. So now, I have to pay for the 4/20 themed “add-ons” so that he can get one next month. I think it's absolutely INSANE that now, not only am I going to be charged $27 for his BarkBox. But I'm also going to have to pay $54 in ""add-ons” just so he can have a 4/20 themed box. Especially after I reached out last month requesting one. It's really upsetting to see that new customers get boxes that existing customers have been wanting since they signed up. I've seen several posts and forum feeds stating the same thing, we should also get a 4/20 themed box in April. Not just the noobies!  That being said, as much as he loves it and as upsetting as it is, after he gets his box next month I'll be canceling our subscription.

Edit: After posting this review, a member of the BarkBox team by the name of Evan reached out to me to see what he could do for me regarding the 4/20 themed boxes. He explained that not all existing customers would like this particular kind of box and that offering it during signup attracts people that would want to purchase it. Since I never received my 4/20 box last year and it’s only available as an add on for existing customers, he gave us next months box for free so I only have to purchase the 4/20 add ons. I just want to thank Evan for going above and beyond for Samson and I, we can’t wait to see what this years boxes have in store!!",2021-04-16,0
Richard White,5,2021-04-17,Great Customer Service,"We have two Bark Box subscriptions for our girls. One showed up today and I have to say how beyond disappointing. Kitsune and Piper usually are excited when they see their boxes have come and are right in there pulling their toys out and playing with them. Both girls checked out the box ... and walked away like “meh” lol . I mean what lame toys. An egg and sausage links?? This box was so not worth the money this month and I’m really hoping when the other box gets delivered it’s not going to be the same and sorry to use the word again but lame stuff that’s in this box. I don’t even think this is April’s themed box and even if it is. It’s a huge let down. I’m starting to regret leaving PupBox and switching over to BarkBox for the girls.

J. Beverly,5,2021-04-18,Love the toys but expect delayed boxes,"My pups love the toys, treats, and chews. However, they have the super chewer box and still go through them with some speed.

I usually love customer service but when reached out, I got basically just keep waiting and it’ll get there eventually. There’s no point to a subscription if you end up buying more toys anyway.

M.A.,5,2021-02-07,December 2020 & January 2021 monthly box,"Gotta bit behind with my monthly box updates so I’ve combined two months.

Sometimes toys get recalled for specific reasons and they let you know fairly quickly which toy it is and what to watch out for. An option is also given for a replacement. 

December’s box theme was the Peanut’s gang! Just love them! Bear could not decide between the Snoopy toy and the Snoopy bone, as he adored both. Unfortunately the nylon bone had to be taken away as the black sides were easily chewed off in little bits. If I succeed in removing all the thin black sides then I think the rest of the nylon bone should be fine.

The replacement toy was a glow in the dark rubber football. It bounces a bit when we play fetch which Bear loves.

January’s box was a hit. Think Bears favorite was the nylon and rubber rose with stem toy. He can chew this or play fetch with me, very fun. The blue goggles ball he adores and we’ve played fetch so often he keeps losing it on our patio. Inevitably it rolls behind a box or plant. Only he can make it squeak which delights him to no end. The nylon bottle opener is another favorite chew toy added to his arsenal. 

I’ve been hiding his treats in his food, it’s fun to watch him move his food around to find them.

Caroline,1,2021-02-08,Awful subscription service,"So disappointed by the service provided by Barkbox in Australia. I have not gone a month in my subscription with them without a problem. Firstly, whatever warehouse they're using here is continually very delayed in sending boxes and I have had to email them in order for my box to be shipped multiple times. Then the treats that were sent were not something that we were interested in at all and very different from the normal cookie type supplied in the American boxes, when we asked to switch to only toys it took an extra month after confirming the box had been switched and another email to customer service to have it actually switched. We were told that we would be refunded the price of the treats, but never were. This month we finally received just toys, but were charged almost the same amount of money as before and not supplied any more toys than we originally had been. So sick of having to constantly contact customer service to have the many problems fixed and even to remind them to send our box. Honestly hate wasting money on this terrible service that they will not let me out of, despite Australian consumer laws saying that I have to be let out of a service if they are providing an unacceptable level of care, which they absolutely are.",2021-02-08,0

The box was ok- we got the heavy chewer box and the toys are so heavy- like filled with concrete.  The treats were ok- but the same as I can get at a local store.  
Then the surprise...48 plus dollars charged to my credit card because my subscription renewed. Even though I thought I signed up for a one box only.  I emailed the company was told- sorry you can cancel but not the box we just charged you for.  SO now I have two more concrete toys, 2 small bags of treats and two very thin chews for 48 dollars.  I wish I even felt like complaining to the company would help- I am just afraid they would bill me for another month.",2021-02-14,0
Bryn,4,2021-01-29,We get the super chewer box,"We get the super chewer box. Ludo (golden retriever) and Duncan (blue heeler, also deaf and blind) are always excited to have toys that last longer than most.  Duncan can chew through basically anything and the super chewer box lends us a monthly chance to enrich his life in new ways.  I love the chews that are sent each month cause they're just the right consistency, I can break them with my hands to stuff into a kong, for hours of entertainment, or I can give one to Ludo and let him teethe his way to adulthood. The toys are always adorably themed and make me smile.",2021-01-29,0

Brandon,5,2021-01-21,A happy momma,Woody loves his new snoopy snow globe and bark box was extremely helpful. After purchasing the item I was bummed when the package got delayed in Maryland for a few weeks and started to get concerned that the package got halfway to its destination and then suddenly stopped. The bark team were kind enough to send me one free of charge (still haven’t received the other one so I figure it got lost in transit) and I was so happy. I love snow globes myself and remember the first one I ever had. When we gave it to our dog woody he fell in love with it too. He loves that it bounces really well and he likes to hold the base in between both paws while trying to squeak the globe part. We are very happy with bark box especially now that we have switched to superchewer.,2021-01-21,0

We still have a lot of the toys which we rotate and appreciate the fact that we always get a heads up on a potential unsafe toy and how it will be replaced with a safer one. Thank you for providing such a great product and have such great customer service. We now added a 2nd pup so might just add a 3rd box.

update....we're down 1.5 toys. The ski lift strap is now gone. We had to cut it off after our problem child chewed it in half...and the ski helmet was torn and we had to throw away. Lasted way longer than we anticipated...this is our second box ..we will definitely try again.

Thank you so much for the awesome toys you have provided my first adopted pet. I cannot thank the bark team enough in being so flexible while we figured out what toys were great for my dog.
Second, I love the themes of the toys and my friends who have been there since adopted Leyla, always ask, what toys did Leyla get? Did she like them?

I had no issues with this company until recently. I went 11 months with no problems, until I never received December’s Barkbox even though I was charged. I was told a replacement box would be sent out which currently “it is”. I put that in quotations because my January box says delivered on the 15th but I never received it. The tracking number provides no results when I go to USPS to track it. Am I supposed to request a second box now just to go around in circles while your company continues to charge me and I get nothing in return? I was able to cancel the auto renewal but then it says I will still be charged another 11 months. Why would I want to continue doing business with you? Why does a company not allow you to cancel right then and there with no further engagement? They need money that bad? These business practices are awful.

Krystin Vee,1,2021-01-20,No Option to Cancel = BAD BUSINESS,"They DO NOT have any option to cancel the service on their website and this is by design, they're one of those very shady companies who tries to lock you in to at least 6 months of service. So, you have to contact support to cancel. Support is trained to try to con you into believing you have to have to finish the x months commitment. This is simply shady business. No subscription worth keeping would have any such nonsense built in. Good subscription services have a cancel anytime feature built into the account section of their website. 

If they pull this shady tactic, state to them that will let your credit card company know they're refusing to stop charging you barkbox will suddenly remember how to cancel your subscription. Shame on them for treating their customers like they're stupid.

It turned out my dog doesn't go through toys fast enough to warrant a monthly delivery and I received a box with treats that were just too big or training (so I had to break them down). I asked if the service could be adjusted for just training sized treats. Through a bunch of super fluffy text, they said no and gave me some pretty 'meh' options. So, I decided to cancel.

Margaret L,1,2020-12-28,They trap you and make it impossible to cancel,"Based on these other reviews I am not the only one. They make it impossible to cancel. I signed up for a “one month” holiday box to gift to someone so I was surprised to see that I was charged for another box the next month. When I contacted customer service they said they could not cancel the box even though it has not shipped yet. Further, Instead of cancelling my account on the spot as I requested, they sent me extremely complicated instructions to “reactivate and deactivate the auto-renewal as auto-renewal is enabled by default on the account and if not disabled through your online dashboard, it will keep on renewing every month.” Why not just cancel it like I asked instead of sending these complicated instructions— and by the way, I could not even locate where to do this on their mobile site. 

It is obvious they are TRYING to make it as hard as possible to cancel. Stay away!! I’ve told every pet owner I know not to bother, as it’s not worth the hassle.",2020-12-28,0
Peggy Dew,1,2020-12-28,Terrible customer service,Terrible customer service. Cannot recommend this company at all. The shipping is completely undependable.

Mark,1,2020-12-29,I signed up in July for a 12-month…,"I signed up in July for a 12-month subscription.  The first box arrived on time, however, every box thereafter was late.  I contacted customer service in November and they sent the October box FEDX it arrived two days later.  The November box arrived in December and the December box was shipped and as of the 28th has never arrived and their customer service department has no idea when it might arrive or where it is.  I tried calling customer service, which was a horrible experience.  I did manage to live chat with John K on 28 December.  All he did was apologize etc.  I asked them to resend the December box like they did for the October box, but his excuse was they could not guarantee it would go FEDX.  When I pointed out that they did guarantee it in October he did not even acknowledge it.  Simple kept repeating the same thing that they were sorry.  Finally, he said he would refund the December box.  I again asked to have it sent FEDX and if he could not do that then cancel the rest of my subscription which still had 7 months left.  He cancelled the subscription.  I asked for confirmation of that, he said an email would be sent, which it wasn't.  This is a horrible company and customer service is indeed lacking.  Look elsewhere for a deliver service for your pups or simply buy toys at a discount store.  As far as treats go, they use the same treats over and over just different packaging for the monthly theme.  My dog does not like Duck and all they ever send is Duck.  If I could give this company 0 stars I would.  I would think that during this time of people staying home and looking for home delivery, a company like this would do more to keep customers than finding ways to drive them away.  Buyer beware.

Dec 30th still waiting....still waiting...still waiting.  Apparently, posting a ""we have sent you a request for more information so we can locate your account"" is a total waste of time.  How exactly should I contact you? Your live chat with customer service disconnects whenever I ask for a new box sent via FEDX.

Jan 5.  Still waiting.  Received yet another email containing the following statement from what is claimed is from the CEO: 

""The shipping industry continues to present us and the entire commerce industry with unprecedented challenges related to historical volume to all shipping networks and slower processing due to COVID-19 safety measures. We are working around the clock with our fulfillment and shipping partners to find more ways to improve your experience.""

When I told them what they can do to improve my experience, still no box, still no replacement box.  Yes, there are delays because of the holidays and yes the World understands Covid.  However, every other company provided updated information on their tracking and all other packages arrived.  There is no tracking for the ""supposed"" replacement December box.   I have tried the online chat three times and keep getting kicked out.  There is no other way to contact these people. And, what is supposed to be cute responses are irritating, especially when customers are upset.",2020-12-29,0
Anna Draper,1,2020-12-29,Is your grandma delivering barkbox with her golf cart?,"Dear Barkbox,

I have read many of the complaints on this page and I share most of them.  Rather than continue the redundancy, I would like to request on behalf of ALL your current and future customers that you PLEASE find a new ""shipping partner"".  Your grandma could deliver these Barkboxes faster.  It is nice that you are always trying to ""make things right"", but let us help you.  We don't want refunds and free boxes.  We want what we purchased--a monthly subscription.  We are experts on monthly subscriptions since COVID, and we know that COVID is no excuse because all of our other subscriptions are still arriving ON TIME.  Just out of curiosity...who is your shipping partner????  Or....is it really not your shipping partner that is the problem 🤔  We don't want you to go out of business, we think your business could have a lot of potential.  You need to get your act together PRONTO.  Charge an extra 5.00 for a better ""shipping partner"" if you have to.  What's wrong with UPS??  Affordable and reliable.  Many subscription boxes even do fine with USPS.  Can you reveal you secret shipping partner? ( We want to avoid them at all costs.)",2020-12-29,3

Kristin Williard,1,2021-01-08,This review is for the BarkShop portion of BarkBox,"This review is for BarkSHOP (part of BarkBox), whose new business model leaves a lot to be desired. I used to frequently order from this company without any problems, but for the past several months, ordering from BarkShop goes as follows:

1. Place an order.
2. Wait 2 to 4 weeks for the company to NEVER ship your package.
3. Battle customer service for a refund. 

That's all ordering from BarkShop is now. You place an order, they hold onto your money for a 2 to 4 weeks and never actually ship your package, and then you contact them to demand a refund. 

I'm not sure how this new business model is supposed to work for them in the long term, much less how it's supposed to generate revenue...but, that's the way they're doing business these days. In fact, that's the way they've been doing business for several months now. I just requested my THIRD consecutive refund for a package that never got shipped. That's THREE orders in a row that just never got shipped. I haven't been able to actually GET anything I've paid for from them since October. 

If you're a prospective customer, save yourself the headache and don't bother. They'll never actually send what you ordered. Instead of ordering from BarkShop, take the money you'd have spent with BarkShop out of your account at an ATM. Wait 2 to 4 weeks. Then, put the money back into your account. It's just like ordering from BarkShop without the added hassle.",2021-01-08,0

Dee Chan,1,2021-01-12,Sneaky business practices,"Barkbox is incredibly deceptive with their business practices. I signed up for a 6 month plan, meaning I only wanted this service for 6 months. They automatically renew without telling you that they are going to do so, and they do not make it clear upon initial subscription that automatic renewal is the norm. 
I am now stuck in another 6 months worth of subscriptions I was not initially interested in. It’s not even that I don’t like their products or services because I do, that’s just a lot of dog toys for my two dogs. 
The other thing they do that I don’t appreciate is they’ll send you a link to add on toys or treats for your upcoming box, and if you click to add said toy to your box it is automatically added. There is no second confirmation for this. So if you change your mind and close out the window, nope! You’ve already been charged for it.
This company really needs to change their business practices. I’ll never deal with them again once my subscription is up.",2021-01-12,0
Rebecca,1,2020-11-26,"Toys not good for big dogs, treats might by making my dog sick","We started a super chewer subscription around the beginning of the pandemic because we thought it would be exciting for him to get presents every month since we weren't going to the dog park anymore. Our pit mix was just over a year old and around 40 pounds at the time, but is super gentle with toys. We actually still have toys that we bought him from target when we first brought him home when he was four months old (now a year and 10 months). The toys from barkbox were destroyed within minutes of getting them, which is extremely disappointing since it is supposed to be a super chewer box. August was our last box, but I noticed when I was checking my account that it was set to auto renew in September, so I'm glad I cought it and was able to cancel before that happened, because they never sent an email telling me it was going to renew. There were always so many treats in the box, but they were dated for a year+ ahead so we always put them in the cabinet and forgot about them. We just recently started using them because we ran out of other treats and they don't expire until next year. All week he's been having diarrhea, throwing up, having accidents in the house, and waking up and crying to be let out in the middle of the night. Nothing else in his diet has changed and he doesn't have any allergies, so I'm starting to think that these treats are what has been making him sick, and I'll just be throwing out the rest. My subscription has been over for about three months now so I'm not looking for any refunds, but him getting sick reminded me of the poor quality of everything in this box",2020-11-26,0

Ashley,5,2020-09-12,"Love, Love, LOVE!","Hello, I’m reading through these reviews and it seems like most dog parents don’t do supervised play. I have a pure bred red nose pit and a lab pit mix. My subscription is to barkbox - my dogs LOVE squeaky toys and soft fluff most of the time. So I’m only paying for 1 subscription but I added the extra toy and recently added the double up option. The customer service team has helped me on multiple occasions. 

My first box was Christmas last year and I was worried it wasn’t going to make it Christmas Day for the puppies to open. I texted the bark team and they got on it like Snow at the North Pole. That box was somehow magically expedited to get there on Christmas Eve for Bane and Harley Quinn to open.

 I had a lost barkbox for July. Shipping delays due to Covid, a train collision in my area and delays from the mail man. I again reached out to their customer service reps and they were able to get me updates on the location, and sent us a free toy and treat for being so patient. There was another time that I wanted to switch up Harley’s diet since she seemed to be having an issue with chicken flavored treats. Again the team fixed my preferences for her and sent us some yummy Scooby Snacks! 

I had problems with the toys being destroyed at the beginning of my subscription because I wasn’t supervising my dogs play time. It took me 3 to 4 months to realize this. I keep the toys in a safe secure box in our living room and when it’s play time we close the doggy door and get the toys out. The back yard is all dirt and with the AZ sun the toys don’t stand a chance out there. So now we have a crap ton of toys built up in this box that won’t be destroyed! Yay problem solved! Lol 

I love this company, I advocate for this company, I can’t get enough BarkBox!! ♥️ I saw they have “Bark Eats” - can’t wait for it to arrive in AZ!! 😍

It was my fault - but they not only switched my subscription, they sent a couple plush toys just because. I have to say the toys have been very popular - he’s a 7 month fairly picky pup but he has been playing nonstop with the toys - he likes that they have lots of little nooks/strings to pull on.

William,1,2020-10-05,Barkbox is anti consumer,"Barkbox utilizes user hostile dark patterns to keep customers subscribed after they have tried to unsubscribe by soliciting what appears to be optional feedback in two separate and additional steps. I completed the optional feedback on the first step and then closed the window. Little did I know, barkbox had another feedback form that was required to ""complete""the cancelation even further. I later went back and checked. There are a total of 8 steps to cancel a subscription. Several of those steps are misleading. Now as for why I canceled in the first place, the quality of the toys is subpar and thus resulting in sometimes dangerous toys for dogs. The super chewer box is the worst offended.

Jay Porter,2,2020-11-10,They dont make it the way they used to…,"They dont make it the way they used to . I have 2 small dogs under 25 LBS. So the toys are always good quality and last for my dogs- but i can see how larger dogs would destroy them fast. They also have been reusing toys for years, so youre likely to get the same toys occasionally. My dogs rarely play with the toys they get but oh well, i prepaid for a year so if they dont like them, whatever. I always donate the ones they dont use. The treats are where this subscription box fails completely. Three years ago when i got this box a few times for my first dog, he loved the toys and the treats were an ever variant rotation of something new, every single box. But now, in 2020, the treats are the same exact barkbox branded treats, rotated and repackaged to fit the monthly theme every month. They get the same exact chew stick every month as well, which gets stuck all in my smallest dogs teeth (an 8 LBS pomeranian). The treats really irk me, since the last box they got something new in was one of the first boxes around may 2020, which were these cool rolled oat treats. Now its either brown squares or brown circles of meaty treats. Maybe its a hard year for barkbox... but it was better a few years ago and not worth it now by any means. Im not paying again and will just use up the rest of my subscription as ive already paid for it.

Edit: it looks like barkbox wanted to try and change my mind about my review and asked for my phone number and such so they could ""look into it"".... but the funny part is, my phone isnt linked to my bark box account so they wouldnt be able to do much anyway! (I'm also certainly not putting my phone number into a random website) Besides, i dont HATE barkbox. I just think its gone downhill since i got it the first time back in 2016 and dont think it's worth the money now. Unless barkbox starts adding a wider variety of treats and toys, it wont be worth it for a lot of people. I'm the kind of person who loves shopping for my pets, so i dont mind going to a pet store once a month and picking some new things. Barkbox makes it convenient, but youre losing individuality and quality when you do that. So you gotta weigh the pros and cons. Do you just toss your dog treats without caring if theres any variety for them? Do you not mind if some toys are wasted on your dog, be it out of boredom or destruction? If thats the case, then barkbox is the way to go! If you do care... save the money and go to petco 🤧",2020-11-10,0

Meaghan Poklinkowski,1,2020-06-16,"Terrible quality toys, rip off on treat bags, even worse customer service","If I could give this service less than one star I would. I first decided to try this SuperChewer BarkBox because my 55lb Catahoula Mix is really hard on toys. I spend anywhere from $15-30 per toy/chew on Løki and I only ever buy all natural high quality chews and treats and toys. Specifically I only by Nylabone as Kong isn’t even safe with this dog. The first box they promote as being $5 a month and then after that you pay the full $30. Well I pay well over $30 a month for Loki’s toys and treats so I decided to give it a try thinking if it doesn’t work out after the first box I’ll cancel. 
Wrong. 
Within the first day of receiving my first box Løki destroyed both toys he received in the SuperChewer box. One had some kind of netting and the other one had fabric on it which he ingested and luckily passed but was clearly UNSAFE FOR DOGS. 
I reached out to customer service and said I wanted to cancel further boxes. Aside from the toys not being useable or safe, the treat bags which are supposed to be “full-sized” are 1/3 the size of a standard fully size bag of the grain, crude, wheat, and corn free treats I already buy him.
I was told I would be sent replacements for the toys Løki destroyed and they would be without fabric or any other soft substance he could shred BUT I COULD NOT CANCEL THE SUBSCRIPTION because apparently they sneak in the contract that you HAVE TO CONTINUE SUBSCRIPTION for a YEAR. 
At this point I’m five boxes in, I’ve e-mailed 4-5 times saying this service is awful and every month Løki tears up the toys and I have to throw them out and I’ve never been given my money back or sent replacements for any of the toys. I’m literally going to have to cancel my debit card to stop paying for this and receiving this awful products.
Listen good dog toys are just going to cost you more money, there’s no safe or good way around that to give your dog a high quality toy that won’t be dangerous to him/her. I still have all the Nylabone toys I’ve ever bought for Løki so in the long run those toys paid for themselves. DO NOT GET THIS SUBSCRIPTION IT’S AWFUL",2020-06-16,0

Elizabeth McPherson,5,2020-06-24,Outstanding caring company and products,"I saw someone’s review saying how they felt about the BarkBox toys. I’m not sure how long ago it was, but I’ve NOT found BarkBox to be anything but exceptional. 

I love how the toys actually are geared to how your dog may play. I’ve got one dog who is a thrasher. He loves to take his toy and thrash back and forth. It’s so funny to watch. I really wonder if he won’t knock himself out some day. Haha. I honestly didn’t know that there were terms for how dogs played until BarkBox. It makes it so much easier now to look for the thrasher toys and get it request those. For the record I also have a shredder. I just learned that BarkBox makes toys that will allow the dog to basically take apart/shred the toy. But then the owner can put it back together again. Perfect!

Next, I can’t say enough on how truly outstanding the customer service is at BarkBox. I know based on my own communication with different people that these employees take pride in their jobs. They honestly want the dogs to have an outstanding experience. Equally important is they want the parents of the dogs to feel that the toys and treats are exceptional for their animals. Plus they do answer any question you might have. 

I rave about this company for no other reason then it’s so refreshing to find people who truly care about you, your pet and also their company they work for and with. It’s not something you see much anymore. 

I would tell anyone that orders the BarkBox subscription or even buys the individual toys, treats and now other products that if you aren’t happy to try and reach out to their customer service team. Don’t just sit and be unhappy or upset with the products, let BarkBox know why and what’s going on. I really do think they want to hear the good, bad, funny, and ugly stories you might have to tell. 

I don’t have any affiliation to this company. I’m not related to anyone who works for this company. I’m just a regular consumer who has reached out to the company on questions and/or complimented the play terms for dogs. It really was worth my time and proved that there still are companies out there that care. 

Thank you BarkBox for all you have done to help my rescue dogs find true happiness. Some of my rescue dogs had never even had a toy before being introduced to these toys. To see true happiness on their slobbery faces gave me equal happiness. :)",2020-06-24,1

Amy ,5,2020-06-29,I love barkbox,"I love barkbox! The box themes are so cute and fun and I look forward to it each month. The toys definitely can range in toughness, so some of the fluffy toys don't last very long but some of them seem to be reinforced to make them last longer. Some of the toys have surprise toys inside, which my dog often likes more than the toy itself. It comes with 2 bags of treats and one chew each month, which is more than enough for us. I don't really understand the negative reviews about customer service, I have always had the BEST experience with customer service out of any company I've ever used. They are available via email or chat, quickly fix issues, and will send replacement toys if your dog is unhappy with one of the toys. They have also sent us toys as an apology when we have had issues. They were even willing to add a new member deal onto our existing subscription! The only minor complaint I have is that some months it takes forever to get our box. It used to consistently come around the 14th of the month but now it can range from around the 10th to the last day. Not a big issue though.

That is when I found out that I was committed to a 12 month subscription. 
I tried to get on the phone with them & could not The only way I was able to communicate with somebody was over text. After a long text back-and-forth they confirmed that they would at least change it to a six month subscription.

Hannah Marie,2,2020-08-07,SuperChewer is not for Super Chewers,"BarkBox, specifically SuperChewer, has let us down time and time again. Our dogs love the treats so no complaints there but it seems like every month we have a problem with one or both of the toys. Fortunately they do have a 100% satisfaction guarantee so they will replace a destroyed toy, HOWEVER, I shouldn’t have to contact them every month about a toy they sent us being destroyed within 2 hours so we can get a replacement. At one point I had contacted them and they said they changed our preferences so that we would only receive nylon toys which I was thankful for. This was good for a couple of months but it wasn’t guaranteed that both toys would be the solid nylon, sometimes it would be just one toy. Then we received a box with toys just made of tough rubber. This was a problem because our dogs chew them up within about 30 minutes to 2 hours and we have to end up throwing them away or our dogs will want to eat the chunks they bite off of it. I decided not to contact the company that month because I didn’t want to deal with that again. Then the following month they did the same thing and the toys were destroyed in hours. I contacted the company and told them both toys were destroyed and even set a photo. They were nice, said replacements were on the way, and changed our preferences so they would receive only nylon toys (which we were told before had already been done). The replacement arrived and I became so fed up. It was only one toy, not two AND it was the a smaller version of a toy they had already received in a previous box AND our box is set to receive toys for large dogs and this replacement toy was for small-medium sized dogs.

For starters something to know about my dog, Peaches, is she's a German shepherd Husky she's a light chewer and loves toys doesn't thrash them, takes her time. While being with bark box every question I've had has gotten answered and fixed if needed, the customer service is great!
First problem I had was I put in code for 3 toys, first box came with two, was confused so I contacted them and I guess I hit wrong suggestion to activate promo. They fixed it and second box came with 3 toys, one being completely free! So 3 toys, 2 treats, and a chew for $22! After that, we got a bag of treats that smelled pretty bad, even for Peach however she is super picky even the other dog's weren't thrilled. Contacted them let them know and they shipped a new bag of treats of my choosing to me for free! Other than that, no issues! For my second year I was going to drop the box and save up but decided to change up my box, they still let me keep my free toy. Talked to them so now I will be receiving 4 toys and a chew since my dog is picky and I can pick her toys and give extras to shelter or family.
On a less positive note, some characters are less exciting, not all are my taste but dog of course is gonna love any squeaky.

I cancelled mine easily before because my dog still had plenty of toys & treats.. there is a phone number because when your dog destroys a toy before 2 weeks of having them you can call & they send you a replacement because the toys are guaranteed to last at least that long. My dog always loved all her toys & treats & now a year later I decided to get her & my new dogs some bark boxes for Christmas! Customer service made it very easy when she destroyed toys before & replaced them so quickly! The only reason for 4 stars because this time shipping is taking a while longer & the shipping date charged.,2019-12-18,0

Meg Burcl,1,2019-12-23,Unethical and Unsafe.,"I have been trying to help my mother-in-law cancel for about a month now. She wanted to get Simon a gift. She didn't catch the 6 month commitment clause when she purchased the $5 box for December which was sold out, so we got something not December themed. My dog destroyed two of the ""super chewer"" toys within minutes in front of me from the first box (the blue rubber squirrel and purple top). I had to quickly grab the pieces before he swallowed them. He is 11 months, 33 pounds, and a black mouth cur. He does not have a strong bite. The quality of the toys are very low. You might as well go to the dollar store, I'm not kidding. The ball they gave us had a weird sticky like material that could be easily cut with children's art scissors. I was afraid to give it to him. We have been emailing and calling them to get a refund and they refuse. They're solution was to send a January box with one less toy and add an additional one in February. We said no, don't send it, it's unsafe. They're newest solution is to send treats instead of all toys. I specifically didn't want the treats because they don't list the ingredients. I can not confidently recommend this company, their products, or allow my dog to use any of these items.

Caitlin,1,2019-11-18,BUYER BEWARE,"In 2017 I started getting my rescue dog the Super Chewer Bark Box. Since 2018 it has been her only source of toys. They used to seem good but I've noticed this year the service has become really bad. The didn't send me a July box even though I paid the whole year in advance and made no real move to correct the error. And some of the toys were looking REALLY tough and hard...even for a ""strong chewer"". 

One day I was in the yard throwing her toys for her and I noticed she wasn't picking them up. That's when I realized about half a centimeter of her lower canine was completely gone. Wondering what the hell she did to do that, I brought her to the vet. That's when I learned the the Super Chewer hard nylon toys are absolutely not safe in any way for dog teeth. Horns, bones, antlers, nylon hard stuff - all bad. Bark Box had been increasingly sending harder and bigger nylon chews but I just assumed, since they're a company claiming safety and testing in their toys, that these things were fine.

She had to be referred to a vet dentist who verified what my vet said. She was scheduled for a root canal. While under anesthesia the vet discovered other chipped teeth and a rear one with a fracture. Thankfully those were less drastic repairs but it was heartbreaking to think she had been suffering in pain for who knows how long. This whole ordeal has also cost thousands of dollars.

When I contacted Bark Box I asked to cancel and be refunded the remainder of my subscription. At first they were very defensive - claiming their toys are perfectly safe and tested before hand. When I asked them for documentation showing their testing is inclusive of safety for teeth they back tracked. They began apologizing profusely and stated they would close and refund my account and that a senior Ambassador would be contacted me directly. That was weeks ago and neither has happened.

Save your dog the pain and yourself the THOUSANDS of dollars in tooth repair - run far away. A quick google search for ""vet dentist approved toys"" should provide options that are actually safe. I wish I had known that this company was completely deceptive in their reputation of having ""safe"" and ""tested"" toys.",2019-11-18,1

Kari,1,2019-11-22,Had the worst experience when they…,"Had the worst experience when they fraudulently lengthened the contract longer than what I had signed up for. I contacted them immediately when I received an email that I noticed that the incorrect term was showing and was online chat for 4 hours before they “accidentally “ got disconnected.  I wrote an email and have screenshots of how rude I was talked to and how I would wait 25-30 between times when the agent would even talk to me.  When I asked to speak to her supervisor I was conveniently disconnected.  The email contact is no better, emailing me at 10 PM at night and then I reply and don’t get an answer until 2 days later at 5:00AM staying they will work with me to make me happy with the box.

The problem is....I didn’t sign on for 6 month box. I tried them one month and didn’t like it & the changed the contract and I have proof of the screenshots of what I signed up for but they said “I’m sorry but disabling autopay won’t stop us from billing you”. I was astounded. What kind of people are running this place.  Thankfully I bought using PayPal and I shot back at him that PayPal is aware of the situation and would not be making any payments to BarkBox on my behalf for any subscription.

It is absolutely amazing and he has not been able to get the squeaker out!

Dee,1,2019-10-02,Just say NO,"Just say NO! I ordered Barkbox and went through all the steps. I chatted with a representative that assured me my toys would be up to par for my chewer. I received my first box today. I had 3 toys and 2 packs of treats and 1 beef stick. The toys were something I would buy at a dollar store. I immediately went to my account to offer to return and cancel. They offered to change my subscription to a higher monthly box and said they didn't accept returns even if it wasnt touched. Would not give me a address to ship it back at my expense nor a phone number.  I have a copy of the chat log and I finally got the agreement that they would send me a super chewer toy and charge me an additional 30.00 since I signed up under a promotional of $5.00 box and that would make my account as a one time order box. They in fact do have a phone number listed on their chat site. Seriously I could have bought everything they sent me for less than 10.00 and they charge too much. They will not let you cancel and there is no cancellation on their site other than to change it to a one time order box and that was only because I placed my order last week and called the day I received the barkbox when I saw the ridiculous items. My baby is a daschund not some huge dog and even he could tear these toys up in 20 minutes flat. Horrible customer service. Just say NO to barkbox. I wish I had read the reviews before ordering.

And when I finally got ahold of them for this which I take seriously because I didn’t know if my package had been stolen off my porch or what they wouldn’t stop with the dog talk and that got old fast. Sure be cute but not when I’m obviously upset.  They took money out ($34) October 3rd 2019 for this months Superchewer box but they still Apparently haven’t even shipped it!?! Cause I’ve gotten zero tracking or updates. Previous months it shipped around the 7-8th so it could get there by the 15th. Then they had the audacity to tell me “All of our boxes SHIP OUT around the 15th” Like Um no. It even says on your site and help desk Q&As that the boxes ARRIVE around the 15th. Otherwise why tf would you need to take my money 2-4weeks early?! Hopefully we get this what I assume to be Halloween themes box before Halloween. 🙄 Just so my dog can tear it to shreds in 5 mins and if I bother to get a “ replacement” the replacement lasts 2 mins. I’m just gonna get my 6 months worth and shop for another subscription or maybe pretend to mail my own box I make for them. ( they love opening the box) sigh. Hopefully this gets better in the future. It blows my mind why there’s so many good reviews. Maybe the little dog box is good? We’ll stick to small dogs only then.

I explained to him my mother had cancer and we had to immediately  move to help her and couldn’t afford to pay for bark boxes any longer. He said too bad, we have to pay. He bashed us online for many months saying we were horrible customers etc.. and using names like c*nt to describe me.we called and wrote bark box several times and let them know what was going on.

I messaged them through their chat. Every request to cancel has been ignored.

Mark Nylec,5,2018-11-30,My Dogs love BarkBox (and so do i),"I have been using Barkbox for 3 months now.  I was first introduced when a company I work with sent a gift box when I got my two golden puppies.  I was very impressed with the quality of the toys and the treats.  

Eventually, I went to the BarkBox website and found it was a subscription.   I am not a big fan of subscriptions so i decided to research how to get out of the subscription.  I found the FAQ, which at the time gave three steps to unsubscribe - 1 and 2 were straight forward - with a link that allowed you to cancel.  Step 3 (which is not on the site anymore) told you to have your dog sit down in front of you and for you to look them in the eyes and whisper, ""I'm Sorry""   ---  Best marketing ever - it made me subscribe immediately - I mean, how could I not?   

Over the past several months we have been very happy with our monthly boxes of toys and treats.  We even kept the November box closed until we had our family over for Thanksgiving - the dogs were thrilled and the family all enjoyed watching them tear into the box to get their box.  

My subscription ends in February - I will likely resubscribe.",2018-11-30,0

Pastel Sy,1,2019-01-14,WORST EXPERIENCE EVER,"I've literally never had the worst service that seemed so strangely upbeat and friendly while frustrating the heck out of me at the same time! Also, when I tried to get a transcript of the conversation, the messenger lies and says it was sent to my email and had not. I did a partnership offer promoted to me through Swagbucks.com (a service that allows you to earn points for gift cards) and was told I old had to spend $22 to receive $40 worth of points. Only $22. ONLY 22 DOLLARS. I somehow was locked into a 6-12 monthly auto-renewing subscription for stupid dog boxes and I couldn't be any angrier. NO FINE PRINT stating such as I was repeatedly told by a upbeat annoying customer representative that countlessly kept asking me about my dog and happy she'd be by me shoving another box in her fluffy face to get her tail wagging another month with BARK BOX'S GOODIES THAT ARE EXPENSIVE AND PUTTING ME INTO FINANCIAL DEBT. Am I being dramatic? Well I tried cancelling to avoid this nonsense and you know they said to me that I agreed to a commitment and therefore they will keep charging me? I don't care if you shortened it from 6-12 months to 3?? Like STOP CHARGING ME. READ OTHER REVIEWS AND YOU'LL SEE I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE. I know Bark Box will reply to my comment. Ignore the load of crap ""Oh we're sorry to hear how crap you experience was with us."" They're money hungry as HECK. WHO DOES THIS TO THEIR CUSTOMERS? I wish I could sue but it's just a damn box and I'm just going to cancel my cards because this is crazy. What the heck guys. Just get your doggie toys elsewhere people.

I got halfway through a bag and my dog starts coughing and had a hard time swallowing the cookie and I looked at the other half of the treat and it had some kind of fiber like substance baked into the cookie. I reach out to them and they offer to send me another bag?? I declined and then they offered to send me another toy. They were not at all concerned that they are sending out who knows what and could hurt an animal? Stay far away from this place who obviously could care less about our pets and will scam for money.

Jack1422,1,2019-01-17,Beware!!!,"If you try Barkbox, be VERY careful you don't somehow get sucked into a multi-month commitment. I signed up over a year ago, paying $20 a month. I just recently made some choices to cut back on my finances. When I went to cancel my Barkbox subscription, I found out that it had just renewed for another whole year & now I'm completely locked in. No email reminder - nothing. And apparently there is just ""nothing"" anyone at the company can do to fix this. I don't even know HOW I ended up in a multi-month subscription. When I signed up, it never said anything about being more than month to month. No one at the company has been willing to help me. I receive very impersonal responses, which are basically a ""robo response"". They say I can cancel, but I have to fulfill my multi-month subscription first - which will be another year.

Also, just a side note: The quality & ""cuteness"" of their toys & box themes have gone wayyyyyyy done. Very disappointing & not fun anymore.

One more thing. Look at all of the bad reviews on here. Barkbox doesn't even respond to the reviews here. This is just a little insight to how AWFUL their customer service is. They don't care about their customers...and it shows. 

I'm not impressed with this company at ALL & I cannot wait until my stupid subscription is over & done with. Beware of what your getting into!!!!",2019-01-17,2

Their solution was to send me a copy of their terms and agreements page. ! I order super chewer boxes for my pitbull, and they are more expensive than the regular boxes (they never used to be). My dog has an over abundance of toys and treats, and I gave that as my reasoning to BarkBox when trying to cancel. Everything was friendly and I even noted that after my pup chewed all the toys she had, I'd probably order again. Not anymore! It's absolutely ridiculous.

I was somewhat relieved when it was all over. Then, when my subscription was actually supposed to end (3-months later), they auto renewed me for another 3-months. Furious, I got online immediately to ""chat"" with someone who apologized for my frustration, sent me pics of her two dogs, and then oddly told me they were ""cuddling"" with her at the moment. The only thing she didn't do was refund my money. Now I'm stuck with another 3-months of junk product.

Courtney O.,5,2018-07-24,They won me over after a mistake that was made. Great customer service.,"If you were to ask me my first opinon of BarkBox versus my opinion of them at present day it would have been two completely different stories.

Here is my side of what happened, and this is why my impression of them has changed.

I first signed up for back box 4 months ago when they were running a special. I signed up for the 6-month bark box and did not read the VERY small, fine print that they had on the sign up which I was under the impression I would get a bark box every 6 months, and pay for them every six months when they ship it. Unfortunately, the small print stated that it was 1 box every month for 6 months and that the price would increase after the first month. 
When I contacted customer service the person I was chatting with made me feel like I was incompetent and that it was my own fault for not understanding and reading the very fine print that was smaller than the other wording at the bottom of the page, so needless to say I was very upset. I was not offered a refund and basically, they told me to just deal with it. So I canceled my credit card and went about my way. I did a review of them after the chat and told them why I was upset and what my issue was.

Within 24 hours of making my review, I was contacted by someone else with the company who had reviewed my chat and felt that I was not treated fairly or listened too and that my concerns were valid enough to where they wanted to make it right. They have since sent me 6 more bark boxes (free of charge) AND donated to a pet rescue of my choice in honor of my own pups who are rescues. 

They ask about my animals by name and have checked up on me twice since to see if my little ones are enjoying the gifts from Bark Box. They also are looking into making sure that other people can understand the terms of their boxes and do not make the same mistakes that I had, as well as working with their chat department to better their customer service in the future.

Bark box has won me over. I appreciate what they have done to fix the issue that was not even their issue to fix. My dogs love bark box and so do I.",2018-07-24,1
EJ O'Neill,1,2018-07-27,Very disappointed,"We have been customers for about a year and until this month things have been going great. Our pups are used to getting their Bark Box on the 15th of the month give or take a day, but it is now the 27th and we are all chasing our tails waiting, waiting and waiting. 

On the 20th, I filled out a support ticket to find out what was going on and was told there are delays this month due to a change in location of their warehouse. Now, wouldn't you think the company would send out a communication to its client base at the beginning of the month letting them know there may be delays this month due to a new location for their warehouse?",2018-07-27,4

Diane Zeise,2,2018-08-09,Frustrating Customer Service Experience,"I was recommended BarkBox by my best friend who had nothing but glowing things to say about the toys and the company. She had a toy break early on and BarkBox sent a replacement and additional toys free of charge. She's also had a few boxes comp'd when there have been shipping delays. 

I was so excited to love BarkBox. First box, first toy, my pup pops the seam in less then 5 minutes (tug o' war with another dog). I request a replacement and was told ""Not to worry, I am going to go ahead and send you out that replacement! I went ahead and marked you down for our more durable plush option at no extra cost, since you said she loves her plush toys. I know you said you wanted to test out a puzzle toy so I am going to go ahead and send you one right now:) Please tell Tonks it should arrive within 3-5 business days!"" 

Great, right? This box never arrived. So, I ask again. I receive the same response... ""Oh no! I'll send you out a few toys for the trouble"". Again, never receive my replacement. I ask a third time and am told they're having trouble switching warehouses, they're sorry, they'll send me even more toys for my trouble. No problem, I say.

1.5 weeks later I get a plastic puzzle toy in the mail. I'm confused, I thought I was supposed to be getting a plush replacement (my pup LOVES plushes) I feel bad for asking a fourth time, but honestly I pay $25.00 a month for this box. So I ask about the replacement plush, as nicely as possible and am told they don't send out the same types of toys if my dog is just going to destroy them quickly, but they'll send me out a plush anyway, even though they don't usually do that.""

HOLD THE PHONE. All I wanted was a replacement plush. But if you tell me you're sending me two-three toys for the trouble you've caused, don't act surprised when I'm confused by the single plastic toy you send. 

Simple follow through would have made me a customer for life. Now I'm itching for my 6 months to be up.",2018-08-09,2

Such a disappointment from what seems to be a solid company that cares about our dogs.  I will be canceling my subscription after I receive this box.

CandyLee,1,2018-08-24,The Cuteness Isn't Enough...Would Rather Get Actual Toys Instead of Emails with Cute Pictures,"Oh the themes are really cute with BarkBox, but with over a year of BarkBox deliveries, I think that not one was delivered at a consistent time. I  would get notice that my account was billed (so I paid for the toys) and sometimes, three or four weeks later, I'd wonder where the box was.  We contacted Barkbox several times, and while the emails were cute, they made promises they never kept.  Oh my gosh, the number of times I received an email saying that they knew they had messed up so they were upgrading us to faster delivery!  Is one month from the date they take my money faster delivery? 

When I'd initiate a chat on their website, or send an email, I was offered replacement items, then would receive an email two weeks later telling me the replacements were out of stock.  Lately, every email has been talking about their new distribution center, but there has been a glitch and so things are delayed.  The new distribution center was supposedly going to make things more reliable - uh, not true.    

Thinking that maybe I needed to communicate dog to dog, I had my 4 Goldens and 1 Pyr (all rescues) send a personal plea to please get the box right, because their mom was threatening to cancel their subscription and buy their toys in other places.  Again, received a cute email response (not nearly as cute as the email my 5 sent) basically saying we were wrong (really?  It takes a month to ship something in the United States?  And I have a transcript of the previous chat that specified what my BarkBox was supposed to contain, which it did not?!?)...and promises to make things better.    THEN, literally 3 days later, another email was received about the glitch in their distribution center and OH - replacement items are now out of stock!  

I'm  actually pretty sure that  BarkBox charged me for a box that I haven't received...oh my, the thought of trying to get that refunded makes me sigh.  I've tried the cute route, I might need to be a little more adult about this communication.  For my pups, I'm going to try another toy delivery service, or simply buy toys through Chewy or hey, even the local pet supply store!  Novel idea!  Support local businesses!

Yeah, I won't be going back to BarkBox.  It makes me barking mad.  I think I might even have some reactivity when I see the words ""BarkBox"" appear in FB feeds and other places...",2018-08-24,3

Then about a week later, I checked the mail and found a beautiful condolence card with a long touching note inside (hand written!) and signed by the staff at BarkBox. They went above and beyond and it is the sweetest experience by a big company I've ever had. When our family is ready for another dog, I know I'll be signing up with BarkBox again without hesitation!",2017-10-19,0
Kat Duncan ,1,2017-12-05,"Terrible experience, ended in painful, expensive surgery for my pup","I had a terrible experience with barkbox. My dog is not a strong chewer at all (he's a shih tzu) but somehow every time we got a box the toys were super cheap and would fall apart immediately. He had never destroyed any toys until we started getting barkbox toys, so after a couple deliveries - I knew they were cheaper than average. They'd basically fall apart within a few min of him playing with them which sucked and was super disappointing, but I never realized it was also dangerous.

On our last barkbox, one toy fell apart immediately when he was chewing on it for the first time (literally within a minute of me giving it to him) and he somehow swallowed the squeaker when it came right out of the toy. I rushed him to the ER and he ended up having a $5000+ surgery as a result to get it out of his tummy to avoid a blockage. He had to be completely cut open. Between the emotional pain of my poor pup having surgery, being in the ICU, having a pain med patch stapled to his back and weeks of recovery, I never trusted this company again. I wish I had never tried them. Now for the rest of his life we have to be careful about his diet and he may need an additional surgery later if scarring builds up over the years due to the first surgery. 

Suffice to say, not a fan and I tell anyone considering trying them this story. I think it is not safe to let your dog (especially a small breed) chew on these toys when they fall apart so easily. I now pick my own treats and toys to be able to know what i'm getting quality wise.",2017-12-05,3

    The soft toys, Stuffed Hedgehog in Winter Plaid.Its still her new favorite toy EVERY DAY! The Cool Winter Dog Snow boot tug was well made and safe untill they met Dee Dee.She promptly opened up a 


boot  and took the stuffing out. AS USUAL the minute she gets a toy in her bed it becomes a Skinz! Ha Ha Ha

If BarkBox would get rid of the toys and concentrate on the snacks, it might be worth it.  However, with every new toy(s) I receive in my BarkBox each month, they are completely destroyed within a week.  They are just cheaply made.

There is an option on their website to cancel your *next* subscription, but not your *current* subscription. And  I saw no indication when you will be billed next, leaving you guessing.

I sent them an email and PLAINLY asked that my subscription please be cancelled. Then I changed my credit card number, just to be safe. And guess what? Yep, they tried to charge me anyway. I don't recall signing any contract, and ""cancel any time"" was plainly shown when I signed up.

They were so hard like bones so I couldn't even break them.
Now on to the toys. 2 toys bigger than my dog! One was a big one shaped like a notebook, about the same size as a real one. Too big for my 5 lb dog! He didn't play with it. The other toy was just as big. Way too expensive to begin with, but even worse that everything in it was useless. 
I tried to call and cancel and they wouldn't let me and said they would send ONE replacement toy and to give them a chance with next month's box. Well, the replacement toy was just as big and useless. The next month's box was ALSO useless! I called again to cancel and they kept saying how I signed up for so many months.

Had I known they would be charging me the full $245 now I would declined. Under their terms of service is states clearly that I will be billed MONTHLY not at once. 
Their website does not have a customer service phone number although they state they do under FAQ. And the link to their customer service has an error and it goes to a blank page. So customer service is very poor. 
I tried to cancel my order the same day I purchased it and it only allows you to cancel for the renewal and not the current subscription. Which they also fail to mention. Although it says under their terms of service that as long as I cancel before the 1st I will not be billed that month. I was not given that option.  But I will be looking for it come the 1st. I've sent a number of emails, all today to different emails I have encountered over the Internet about this company and we shall see the responses I get.
I would have continued with my order had they billed me every month for the $19 and not the full amount. Like I said, I placed my order today and am trying to cancel today. Legally, they have to have an option of me canceling my order so I will update.

They would not refund my money. I just got my second box that I paid for weeks ago, and it's the same deal. They like the treats, but I can go buy better toys from Walmart for less.  I was told it would be cancelled after this box, and I really hope that's the case. It's not worth $25...",2018-09-20,3

They give you no option to opt out of a subscription and don’t know how to answer calls, texts, or Facebook messages even though it’s on their website. The only way you can opt out is by replacing your card or shutting your transactions off so they don’t take your money.

rokonrae,5,2019-07-19,I LOVE Bark Box,"I have been with Bark Box for about a year.  I first subscribed with a 6 month subscription. And in April (2019) I re-subscribed with a year's sub.  I like this subscription box a lot more than the previous one I had been getting for my dogs.

The only issue I had with receiving a box was actually USPS's fault for delivering it to the wrong address.  

I love Bark Box.  Out of the three subscriptions I get (two being make-up/skin care boxes) Bark Box is my favorite and it's not even technically for me.  The toys that they send for my dogs very rarely have squeakers that are too small for my large dogs.  And more often than not there is very minimal stuffing.  The treats are always high quality.  I've even gone so far as to order from the Bark Shop with absolutely no issues.  

I recommend Bark Box every chance I get.",2019-07-19,0

I explained that she chewed up the toys and ultimately swallowed some of the parts and I didn’t trust her with them.  Barkbox wasn’t interested in my concerns they already received the years subscription.  About 2weeks ago we received our Barkbox so I thought we would allow Bailey to play with a toy while we ate dinner so that I could keep an eye on her.

He has only ever gotten one toy he didn’t like. This toy was quickly replaced with one that the rep and I thought he would like better. He is signed up for the extra toy so we have close to 80 toys. We still have all of them. Most have been washed multiple times. We added a St. Bernard to the family. She is a rapidly growing puppy (currently about 110 pounds). They have shared the same BarkBox toys for 6 months. None of the toys are destroyed, and that includes toys they use to play tug of war with each other. All of the treats are regularly consumed.

They sent us 1 acorn and 1 chewy treat and 1 bag of treats. NOTHING ELSE. And online when we go to check to see what they alleged they sent us, they said they sent us multiple things we never received. So, we essentially got charged for things we didn't receive. We were also told by the rep they would make sure they didn't send us rubber toys anymore - get this, THEY SENT US A RUBBER ACORN.

PocketsizedCosplay,1,2020-02-21,Not listening to anything.,"I got a 6 month subscription + extra toy. So i am to recieved 3 toys each month.(accidentally with the free first box) so when box #1 came i was super excited to try the toys. We got 3 crinkle toys tht we saw the dog was scared of. So i messaged them saying he doesnt like the crinkle can we not get those again please. They assured me that they made a note of it and will send a free toy. Box #2 comes and its 3 crinke again. So now im upset. I message again saying i got crinkle toys (i took screenshots of the messages) they promised a note on the file and a free new toy which i hadnt received from the first apology. So box #3 comes around and i am very optimistic and guess what i got...... 3 CRINKLE TOYS AGAIN....so im raging now. I have talked to them after each box and 2 different people reassure me that they made a note and sending a free toy which hasnt happened still. So now i want to cancel. They keep telling me that its fixed and on note. They REFUSE to let me cancel. Trying to get me to switch to another box if im unhappy but i dont want that. I want correct things. They say i have to pay for all 6 months. Which i am not gonna do. 

I try to cancel every way possible while waiting for them to call me so i can try to resolve this. They call and the lady gives me the same spiel as all the others. And tells me that she is so sorry but there is no way to modify the toys in the box. (So explain to me why not one person told me that! They all lied then saying it was in the file now) she says she cant cancel but she can change my subscription to a 1 month box which give 4 treat bags and 4 chews (No toys so there is no way to get more crinkle) I said ok and if i dont like it i cant cancel after? I am told yes by barkbox. 

So i just got home and i just opened this months barkbox. Box #4 which should be 4 chews and 4 treat bags
And i received? *drumroll*
3 CRINKLES 
2 treat bags
And 1 chew

Only a 5-in long piece of medical tape was used to secure the whole packaging; contents of the box could’ve fallen out. I’m wondering why they didn’t use normal packaging tape. For $32, you will not get your money’s worth. Barkbox will ask you to fill out a survey so they can customise a box according to your dogs’ breed, weight and size. Oh goodness, I think they send me items for a “medium” dog when it should have been for a “small” dog. My dog can’t use the toys, but at least she can eat the treats? Nope, my dog showed no interest in anything from the box. Also their customer service is very very bad. Upon realising that I didn’t want to continue monthly subscriptions with Barkbox, I cancelled my subscription (of course). The next month, I was charged another $32....I contacted them through text, email, customer support and live chat without success. Finally, I received an email from them assuring me that they would refund me as long as I give them feedback on how they could improve AND reason why I wanted to cancel. I wrote them back kindly and until now, they haven’t given me the refund I requested. :(

Ashley ,2,2020-12-25,Made my dog sick,"I originally bought my dog Kong boxes but fell for bark box’s cute themes and bought the 6 month subscription. The Christmas themed “Peanuts” box arrived a week later than expected and they used a delivery company I was not familiar with. It is a busy holiday season so this may not be they’re normal. They did give me a discount due to the box being late. 
When the box did arrive however, my dog started playing with the ‘snoopy’s bone toy’ which was made out of a durable material however it had a plastic black border to make it look like a cartoon and when my dog bit that off it came off in extremely sharp chunks. Luckily my dog always spits out stuff like that but it could have turned very bad very quickly. We also gave her a few of the treats that came along with the box. We only adopted my dog 3 months ago but we have given her a wide variety of treats and dog safe food to put in her toys. She has never once vomited but after giving her these treats she threw up. These treats may not be the cause but I find it more than coincidence that this was the one and only time I’ve seen her get sick. I contacted customer service and was able to get my six month subscription canceled which I appreciated but the safety concerns it posed to my dog were undeniably very scary and I don’t recommend even trying one box. Even though Kong boxes may not be as ‘exciting’ all the toys and treats have been safe and tough chewer approved.",2020-12-25,0
Connor Dunn,2,2020-12-26,Sad little puppy without a box for Christmas :(,"I am super frustrated with this company as the shipping problems are unreal. I understand its around Christmas and New Years but the shipping speed is so unacceptable. I have ordered amazon packages that have come the same day. Therefore, I don't understand why my package should take 20 days to get to my house. My first initial package shipped on December 5th and it is still not here. The replacement one is not here either. 
I try to be very understanding but c'mon. They ship like they are out of China. They are out of Kentucky. This should not take this long. I literally live in Florida I am only 11 hours away from Kentucky. 
My pup did not get her box for Christmas. This is her first Christmas with us and she did not even get her presents. What a shame. The company has tried to make right with a replacement box and refunds but at the end of the day my box is still not here. 
I don't understand how they send out replacement boxes that go the same speed as the previous ones. Send that box priority if customers are complaining. I sent a package to my mother in law priority mail and it got there two days later. I think they should be sending out boxes at a higher speed if customers have already complained before. 
I have texted this company complaining two times already and yes they have tried to make it right. But still, very unacceptable shipping. The sad thing is that I love Barkbox their toys are so fun and themed. I go to stores just to buy their toys. I love them so much. I love the subscription and almost upgraded it. However, I can't love a box I have not gotten yet. I just don't understand my first pup got his box in the middle of December and my other pup STILL does not have her box. 
The customer service is always lovely and they do try hard to make it up to you. But, I still don't have my box. I even paid the whole subscription off for both my boxes I am a good customer. I get so upset every day that I have to wait for my subscription that I paid for. Reading the comments many other people are having these issues. Please consider shipping your boxes a different way Barkbox.",2020-12-26,0
Kathy T.,1,2020-12-27,Greatly disappointed,"I buy all Kong toys because my puppy loves to chew, but I opted for the pupcorn  toy for a Christmas gift. In 10 minutes, it was thrown in the garbage because it ripped so fast and he almost swallowed the squeak part that is not sewn inside properly. I am truly disappointed but glad I watch him carefully so he won’t choke!",2020-12-27,0

Brandy P,2,2021-01-13,Long time subscriber reconsidering,"I have been a Barkbox customer for a very long time, so many years that I can’t remember, which is the only reason this is a 2 star review.  Like apparently all of their other customers, I still haven’t received my December box.  I can’t even get on the site to track it anymore because there is an “error” in site and the app.  Despite Barkbox surely being aware that (most) customers never got what they paid for in December; I have received no updates, no refund, no communication whatsoever from Barkbox....except an email confirming that they just charged me for January’s box.  This is just unacceptable customer service.  I am reevaluating my subscription pending the outcome of the December box and the timeliness of the January box.

UPDATE: 1-21-21   Barkbox reached out to me following my review, refunded my December box and sent a special birthday box for my pup’s birthday this month.  I also received the January box today.  It appears that December was an uncharacteristic month for Barkbox.",2021-01-13,0

My dog started to chew up the toys around month 4 - it left a mess in the house and the squeaker has gotten stuck in his stomach. I switched to the ""super chewer"" box and was disappointed. The ""chews"" are gone within 1-2 minutes - really more of a large treat. The toys are definitely more durable, but my dog is not very interested in them. I ended up sending $40-50 on tough toys from Chewy and it was a much better use of my money! I will also say they send SO MANY TREATS! I have heard this from friends, as to why they stopped ordering the box, and now I understand. 2 bags of treats every month is a lot of treats! We probably use 1, max.",2021-01-20,0

I threw it out and thought nothing of it, but a day or so later I saw an email addressing the situation BarkBox was quick to advise customers to throw the toy away and offered an extra toy to for all the dogs who had received it.

And now that we're part of the nylon club we haven't had to contact them for replacement toys because the toys meet his need and do not get destroyed. Customer service is quick to respond and very helpful.

We all love the nearly indestructible toys but the treats might win the show. I have used some treats as training treats and now we are getting jerky treats too. I love the sticks because they split nicely for a treat that isn’t swallowed immediately. Ginger also has a chicken allergy that is accounted for by our friends at Bark. Treats are high quality. I feel good about what I am feeding my dogs. They are very good girls and get treats very often. If you are having trouble deciding, just get a box. You will not be disappointed!",2021-01-21,0

Thank you Evan for your help and thank you BarkBox for allowing your employees to assess and correct situations that are truly mistakes.




I have had BarkBox for 3 months.
First 2 months were ok but the 3rd month wasn't the toys pictured on my online profile that was supposed to be sent.
I looked at my subscription and it didn't seem to be what I originally signed up for so since it said to there was time to add to your box by 2/22 that was to be sent in March I made the change.
What was not made clear enough as I never read anything that popped up or stated any different is that if you make a change is that it will pre-bill you and charge the upcharge immediately if you make a change not when they are going to ship in March.
So with that said you can imagine what that did to my account. 
Just read all the fine print that to this day I haven't seen so not obvious.",2021-02-17,0

The only thing that changed was the treats which came from bark box.  The culprit in the box was either pork jerky treats or the pork chew bar, which was cut in half and half given to each dog.  The pork chew bar is the one I am leaning to as the problem. They say their treats are from Canada and the US and are made from natural products but I will never give my dogs treats from them again.",2021-02-17,0

They use a subcontractor of DHL that is very unreputable.  

After waiting almost a month for my package, and hours on the phone tracking it, there is nothing to be done for it.  Have tried to cancel the subscription, but nothing but problems.  

If they are unable to deliver what good are they?",2021-02-18,0
Matti Green,1,2021-02-20,Struggles with Customer Service and Shipping,"My dog and I absolutely love the products we receive from BarkBox, so much, that I pay extra for a double box, and addons each month. 

That being said, the customer service offered by the company is exhausting. I have had shipping issues with them each month, and can never get straight answers. Each time I attempt to contact their customer service, I am connected with a new representative, which is fine, but I am having to constantly explain myself. Also, I get a different answer with each representative I work with. 

This most recent issue with my February box has really pushed me over the edge. I was charged, early February, of course, and was looking to expect my box by mid February. During the 2nd week of February I logged in to find that my box was still preparing to ship. Just to be sure everything was alright, I checked in with customer service. I was told that boxes ship within the first 2 weeks of the month, and not to worry. I thanked them and moved on with my life. I periodically checked back on the status of my box, and finally on the 16th of February, I reconnected with Customer Service. The rep I worked with on that day apologized for the delay and explained that my box WAS STILL at the warehouse, and that she was going to look into what happened, and why it wasn't sent out. Unfortunately, the chat was disconnected before I had an answer, but I did receive a followup email once again apologizing for the delay, and informing me that they were investigating the shipping delay and would get back to me within 24 hours. I of course trusted that information, and waited. On February 19th, after not hearing anything, and still not seeing the box, I logged in to see that the status of my box had changed to Shipped. The 'shipping' date was February 13th, which was 3 days BEFORE the previous rep had told me the box was still at the warehouse. Before checking in with Customer Service again, I used the tracking information provided to check the tracking. When I input the tracking id into the FedEx website, it stated that FedEx had only received the shipping information, and that only the label had been created, but they had not received the package. Of course, at this point I reconnected with Customer Service. The rep I was paired with was not helpful. He kept stating that all he could see was that the box was shipped on the 13th and that they no longer had the package. I explained my frustrations about the different answers I had been seeing, at which point the rep offered me a partial refund of $15, (I paid $90 in February). I went on the express that more needed to be done, as something was obviously amiss. The rep just kept repeating that there was nothing they could do. I then respectfully asked if I could end my subscription after this month. The rep of course went in to ""keep the customer"" mode, and asked what they could do to make it up to me. I explained that I feel the issue had been taking too long, and I would just prefer a full refund for the month of February, of which they replied that they could have the next months box sent FREE. Of course, this isn't what I wanted, so I just asked if there was a shipping investigation that could be started for my package. The rep stated that he initiated one, and that they would look at the tracking information from ""time to time"" to check in. I then asked if there was any documentation that the package was given to FedEx, at which point the rep ENDED THE CHAT. I then reconnected with ANOTHER agent, who was definitely more helpful, but still didn't give me any clear answers. This rep gave me the partial refund, and stated that the issue was marked as high priority with their logistics team, but that I wouldn't be able to contact back until mid next week. I agreed and asked for transcripts of the conversations for my records. 

If I'm not able to get the issue resolved during my next conversation, will be working to end my subscription. 

I want to mention that I also work in customer service, and I 100% understand logistical issues. That being said customers should not have to deal with the same shipping issues month after month after month. Although I have been happy with the products, I am not happy with the customer service.",2021-02-20,0

Framulation,4,2021-04-20,"Late shipping due to growing pains, but fun boxes","I can tell you that my dogs look forward to getting their treat box from Bark Box every month. The these are funny/punny and I love seeing my dogs sit with waggy butts as I open and give them their toys and treats. This is the type of thing that I would be a furever member to, but the company  takes my money on the first of the month, ships the product 20 days later, and then I get it it 25 to 27 days after they charged me. To get the products so late makes me frustrated. I am sad to let it go.

UPDATE: Within an hour or so of this post, Evan from BarkBox reached out to me to discuss my experience, and was very honest about the company growing and the challenge that it has posed with one million+ subscribers. I appreciated this hinest and genuine customer service outreach as well as the refund.

AngG,4,2021-09-09,Definitely worth the monthly expense,"After pricing new toys at the pet store over the weekend, we figured we would spend $40 on a Super Chewer box and give it a try.  The box arrived 2-3 days after I placed the order. I ordered an extra toy in our Super Chewer box so we had four toys, two full size chews, and two full size treat bags in the box for less than $40.  They are incredibly durable for my nine-month old Pittie pup, with the exception of the one add-on toy--it was a two-part toy that had been glued together and I asked for a replacement because a tooth could have easily separated the two pieces from each other.  I emailed BarkBox with my complaint and received a reply within 10 minutes saying that I would have my replacement toy asap.  They didn't even ask for picture proof!  I can't say anything about the replacement toy as I haven't received it yet, but I am confident that it will be an acceptable replacement.  I have to add that there is a monthly subscription box that ""caters"" to Pitts but the one and only box we received from them wasn't even close to the quality of toys in our BarkBox box.  Don't waste your money on cheap copy cat subscription boxes and over priced pet store toys.  Each toy in our Super Chewer box would easily cost over $20 at a pet store.  I have also had Bark Box subscriptions for our two Pomeranians and always received good quality toys and treats that the dogs loved to play with.  I had to cancel the first subscription because we had too many toys!  I gave this experience four stars because of the replacement request and because our girl was able to chew off part of a new toy last night.  Granted she's been playing with it and the other toys for almost a week, but I had to clean up the mess and finish what she started before giving the toy back to her. I can't expect the toys to be indestructible as she would probably crack a tooth, I'm just happy to watch her play with something more than once or twice before I have to throw it away.",2021-09-09,0
Patricia Vittetoe,5,2021-09-09,Good investment,The toys and treats are very good. The sword (M) is a little heavy for my 35 lb boy (Dachshund/Labrador mix)but he loves chewing on it. The dragon (M) was ripped apart in less than an hour but the “dragon egg ball” inside was a nice surprise for him. The helmet treat dispenser (L) holes let out too many treats (kibble) at once but I just tape over the larger holes. The treats are a bit high in calories but he loves them.,2021-09-09,0

Customer service was Great!  Happily replaced those toys with Super Chewer (solid nylon) ones, that she enjoys and has been working on ever since.  I was happy enough with BarkBox to sign up for the monthly box.  Lucy has had just one box so far, but she was over-the-moon with it.  Now, whenever a package is left at door, she Races to smell the box to see if it's for Her!  [a new behavior since she opened her 1st one.]",2021-09-30,0

When I complained, they cancelled it but did not refund my money for the unwanted month. That's a SCAM. On the whole, not a great deal.

However, it was difficult to pick her size just by weight. she is about 20 lbs and a chihuahua-bichon mix. She has a stout little body with short legs and a small chihuahua sized mouth. So going by weight, the toys were slightly too big for her. She loved the hippie chick and she likes the bus but can't squeak it. I have revised my size options on the site.

I’ve never had a negative experience with customer service, they respond same-or-next-day, and they 100% stick to Scout’s Honor (replacement toys, subscription help, etc) 
seriously, save your money on those cheaper toys you think will last and get your dog a monthly box. ..my dogs know when their box has been delivered —i think it’s those healthy and doggo-mouth watering treats— but cutest part is how fkn excited they get, sometimes they’ll even try to open the box before i can

Toni ,5,2021-10-18,A true Rarity!,"We have subscribed to super chewer Bark box and have been very pleased. Our Airedale Terrier loves to chew but we weren't sure of her preferences.  Bark customer service has been wonderful! We had make adjustments on what worked for her and what didn't. The toys are good quality (much better than previous subscripion box we tried) and our pup loves their treats. They gave us no hassle about substitution when we discovered chew sticks were not a great option for her (She doesn't chew these, but gulps them and can't digest the big chumps she swallowed). Also fabric items caused similar concern, she tried eating them. With Bark, they work with you until a good combination is found. Each dog is different.  I really appreciated them working with us to find the right fit. Our year old pup was quiet the challenge but we believe we finally customized her box and she is thrilled.

My dog loves to receive his BarkBox each month. He plays with every toy and enjoys the treats that are included. The toys and treats are just right for him.

Misty Smith,5,2021-10-18,Best Company for your dog hands down!!,"When I originally placed my order with Bark Box it was for both my dogs.  While we waited for shipment and arrival one of my dogs had a very sudden unexpected turn for the worse.  Two days after we had to make a very hard decision our box arrived.  Her best friend and our other dog was listless and horribly grieving her absence.  The arrival of the box was bittersweet. Two toys, two treats, two snacks for them to share. However, his toys turned him around. At first he only sniffed but within a few minutes he started wagging and hasn't put them down since.  As I type he working hard to remove a squeaky he has been unable to damage this far inside his ball.  In the midst of this I was asked to review our box. I explained in email exactly what I'm explaining now and fully anticipated an auto response type email especially on a weekend.  Nope. A kind and sympathetic customer service member responded personally within minutes and exchanged emails back and forth several times allowing me to share pics of our fur babies and helped.me with my grief. She offered info on how to help our grief as well as our dog. And they do live up to the guarantee that if your dog can chew through a toy they will replace it. Worth every single penny 10x over.  My dog and my family will stay with Bark Box as long as we have furbabies or they remain in business.",2021-10-18,0

Pamela Gordon,4,2021-10-22,Best of Canine Toy Market,"Bark has the best dog toys, hands down. Their toys are engaging and interactive. The box themes are as much fun for your dog as they are for the humans. Some toys even sport the unique feature of having a ball or more toys stashed inside a larger plush toy, so the fun doesn't end when the fluff flies! The quality rivals most children's toys, and they offer generous size proportions for most breed sizes. The only reason for not giving five plus stars is that with the box subscription, along with the toys, they offer treats and chews mostly containing dairy ingredients which I oppose for my pup. Overall, great ""BANG"" for your buck company. They also offer an online shop with many one of a kind and sensational finds.",2021-10-22,0

Lesley Jones,5,2021-11-05,My dog loves his BarkBoxes,"My dog loves his bark box packages.  Now every time a package arrives at my door my dog assumes it is for him.  The chew toys actually last him over a month.  When I would by toys to chew on from the store they would be shredded within a couple of days.  Maybe due to him chewing more as a puppy, but the bark box toys are more durable and still soft.  Some don’t last very long and that’s okay as my dog has a blast “defeating” his new arrival.  

The treats are very good, with nice ingredients, they seem healthier than store provided treats and at a reasonable price if you want to order one again.  He really likes the maple bacon chews and the little jerky sticks. 

Each box is very creative, my boyfriend and I look forward to the fun themes.  There are also options if you want more toys or less and the price will differ.  This is a good option so you don’t feel locked into a subscription and also depending on what amount of toys and treats are right for your dog.  My dog did not need so many toys and treats each month so we were able to move to a smaller box for him at a lower price.  You can also use an add ons feature every month incase you want to select a certain type of toy or treat in addition to what is selected for each box.

Very happy with this company and they also go out of their way if there is ever an issue with an order or delivery.  Customer Service department actually follows up with you!!",2021-11-05,0

I knew BarkBox toys are durable for moderate use, as my dog-friendly office has a dozen or more toys on hand for play.

Customer Service quickly helped me change my order to Spider-Man No Way Home, and the box arrived soon after. So many snacks and toys, in unique shapes that appeal to my dogs because of the variety. Crinkly toys are a big hit with both corgis. Can't wait to see what my next box brings.",2021-12-08,0

Jacob Karlsson,4,2022-01-10,First Bark Box,"This was our first bark box, our little puppy enjoy the majority of the items. She really likes the fried egg toy. The snacks were not a huge hit but then again she’s not a huge fan of treats (surprising for a pittie, I know). Make sure you also read the labels as it is not always evident if certain things are safe for puppies etc. 

The absolute best was the promotion for the Yeti Dog Bowl ! Like, are you kidding ?! This was a deal I couldn’t turn down especially for Rosie. She is an avid outdoor enthusiast already with our family and couldn’t think of a better gift. 

I will be purchasing again for a friend and keeping my subscription.",2022-01-10,0

JKLake,3,2022-01-28,Pros and Cons,"Pros - All the rubber toys are great. The Bubbler keeps both dogs busy and is tough. The treats actually get chewed and tasted. Price is fair. Customer service and shipping are fast.

Cons - customer service was quick to review my purchase and respond to my disliked item. I was very impressed that a replacement was shipped immediately. Unfortunately, I got a replacement that was made of the same nylon we asked be removed as it was unsafe for my dogs. A double pack of treats or one of the ""bonus"" items as a remedy would be a better option than resending the same material when a different material isn't available. 
The checkout process for subscriptions is disjointed. I checked out twice and chose prepay both times but have one prepaid and one monthly charged subscription. The option to pay the balance in full at the discounted rate would be nice.
Lastly, I turned my auto renewal off and was given the impression my subscription was cancelled and had to verify my account settings to check. The confusion felt intentional. Not a fan of the automatic renewal enrollment.",2022-01-28,0

We just subscribed as I thought that it would actually be cheaper than buying individual toys for our heavy chewer doggie. So far so good! Our Juni loves the treats and the toys. One toy, Juni chewed off the thinner edge pieces on (it was a pizza slice with melted cheese off the edges in a few places that she evened out) and bark Box ungraded our her chew toys to the max chewing capacity when they get wind of this. The pizza is still mostly intact and one of Juni’s favorite toys still (we got it towards the beginning of January). We have been slowly replacing toys she has prior to bark box with the bark box ones as they go to toy heaven. So far we have been super impressed with the quality of everything and find ourselves looking forward to the next themed box!

Thank you.  We are looking forward to next shipment.  He has to have his nose into the box to see what there mite be in their for him.

I have Multiple Sclerosis, he is my ""therapy"" dog.  Not officially, but I call him that.  I lost my husband and son within the last 5 years, so dr. recommended for me to have a companion, couldn't have picked one out that would be as much help that Breo is.

Rachel Ackerman,5,2022-03-02,Awesome Customer Service,"After having BarkBox recommended to me, I sought out the monthly subscription for my 4 month old puppy. Once I signed up I realized that I should have picked the Superchewer box instead of the regular box due to my dog’s breed and chewing habits. I reached out to customer service to see about switching options. 

I have NEVER had such wonderful customer service. They were very prompt in responding. The Rep was able to switch over my subscription, apologized for the inconvenience and sent me two replacement toys. In addition they let me know that I can reach out anytime, they asked how me my dog was enjoying her box and asked for a picture of her to share with the team. After I was sent surveys about the box and my experience with customer service. I hadn’t filled out the box survey with comments (I got distracted in the middle of the process) and they reached out to me to make sure everything was ok.

 The emails are a puny and sweet. They also include pictures about their own dogs which I think is sweet. I look forward to future interactions with them",2022-03-02,0

Not only was the box great, but the customer service was even better. I contacted them about allergies after the deadline, expecting that the adjustments wouldn't be made until next box. They responded so quickly and even sent a replacement bag of treats for the first box since one of the treat bags didn't match Comets allergy needs.

There was no one toy that he particularly liked, however, and I think it was they were all pretty much the same — round, soft, squeaky dog toys, about baseball size. He really couldn’t get his mouth around them, and they were difficult for him to squeak because of the size.  Maybe include a different shape or smaller or something harder. My pup is a chewer and he will chew anything.  The little stick treats he finished in about a minute. He liked them but I prefer something that occupies him for more than a minute. He also enjoys chewing on squeaky rubber/plastic (?) toys. Loves them! I don't know if Bark Box carries those.  But overall, the theme was cute, and it was nice for him to have something new in his toy box.",2022-03-03,0

Kelsey Managhan,5,2022-03-25,Momo knows,"Every month we love getting in a new BarkBox. I even let Momo open it for himself, for the most part, I cut the tape and cut the tags off the toys then put everything back in its place so that he can have the fun of opening his own toys. He even knows when his box has been delivered and that it is in fact for him. We love the variety of treats that we get and that they are the perfect size for him. We are still working out which box size is best for him but overall, Momo doesn't seem to care because he got a new toy. Very nice way to spoil your pet without going overboard!",2022-03-25,0

For years I bought chew toys for them that wouldn't last an hour dispite being ""indescructible"".  I came across the bark box and figured I would give it a try. I haven't regretted it since. I've been a member for close to two years now. My pups actually learned what the box looks like and get super excited to find out what treats and toys they received for the month. Its like Christmas every month when that box shows up. And them toys actually last months instead of an hour and I the treats dont last the month. Absolutely satisfied with this company and their products.",2022-03-26,0

That way both dogs get to enjoy the unboxing process! Both dogs love the treats they send and the toys are always a big hit. The company as made changes whenever necessary. Their customer service has gone over and beyond for us to make sure we are happy with our Bark box. I highly recommend them to all dog owners.

We are so very happy with our experience! I initially ordered the super chewer box- this was completely my fault because I am the one who chose to order the super chewer, assuming that my pup needed the most durable toys. I was wrong... the super chewer toys were way too tough for my pal. I did the ratings so that barkbox would know to give us less tough toys next time and they reached out- offering replacements even though it was not their fault that my pup did not like the first ones. Now we are SUPER happy and LOVE his new toys!!! THANK YOU SO MUCH!

When I finally caught on that I had been involuntarily signed up for an additional 6 months (!), I had to jump through hoops to cancel: waiting in long chat queues (no way to speak by phone), misinformation from customer service, and finally hard-sell tactics to try to get me to stay on. My dog is a super chewer and the toys they sent either fell apart in minutes or were made of a super hard synthetic material he had no interest in. In 10 months of toys, he liked maybe 3 of them.
