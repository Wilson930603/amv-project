Heather D.,5,2023-07-05,No More Itchies!,"My 9 year old pit bull developed terrible skin issues. It wasn’t diagnosed by a vet, but it was very visible. She had spots of dryness, but she also had spots that were severely dry & scaley that they would sometimes open up. I was trying different remedies on the irritations, but it wasn’t going away. I decided to try the Kibble of the Sea & I’m amazed at what it did for her. She doesn’t have any more skin issues, absolutely none! It all cleared up. I am just upset with myself that I didn’t try this food sooner for her. My pittie & I are so grateful!",3,0

Roxy and I bought it immediately, not expecting much. Roxy bought the Bada Beef food topper also. 
    Fast Forward to today.  She eats a serving size at least every day. Which is more than 1 and 2 kibbles here and there with any other brand.

Charlene P.,5,2023-07-04,Best ever!!,"Our Shih Tzu pups LOVE these. We give them as a bed time treat and they go nuts when the bag rattles.  One of the girls has always had horrible breath, she’s a rescue,  around 4 years old, and we have noticed an improvement. The other is a puppy, 11 months old, and thinks these are the holy grail! They were recommended by a friend whose vet was amazed at their 7 year old Golden’s teeth. He asked how often they brushed his teeth. They told him never, they give him these. The vet could not believe it and said “Well don’t stop!”  So now their newest Golden is on them too. ",0,0

She didn’t eat her entire 1/4 cup serving, but funny, she did, very meticulously, pick out and gobble up every single Itty Bitty Chicky kibble, leaving behind a small amount of the Royal Canin.  I’m impressed, she hasn’t seemed to enjoy that much, any of the 4 kibble brands we’ve tried with her.  We’ll see how this one impacts her digestion, but so far so good.

Kian V.,5,2023-02-06,Definately the Flavorite,"I started to transition her from old food to new food. she ate around the old food, just going for the new stuff. She is a very picky eater, if we even got a different flavor of the same brand, she didn't want it and would tip over her bowl in protest. NO issues with this one. she didn't even want her old food once she noticed the new food. Thankfully there were no tummy issues because it was a quick shift. she wanted it her way.
the main reason i wanted to switch to this brand was her old food was getting expensive. it went from $45 for 19lbs to $95. i couldn't afford it anymore. I have been using bark box for her treats and toys for almost 3 years now and have not had any issues that were not resolved or explained well.
