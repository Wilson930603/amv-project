It is not as moisturing as before,, the pleasant scent is almost gone, and the color is now a chalky white which means more or a different type of sunscreen. Also, I notice my eyes are sensitive when using it. This is my second jar bought in 2022 since it came back. The first jar seemed OK, but this new jar is not the same at all. I am saddened that my favorite day cream has changed, but since Dr. Brown does not own the company any longer, new owners try to up their products , as we see new products coming out every few months.

To make matters worse, the skin around my eyes always felt dry and irritated. Even as early as my first use of this product, I felt the difference in the skin around my eyes. Over the years, I've tried everything on the market and I don't exaggerate when I say everything yet I always find myself returning to ReVive. Your products work perfectly on my dry hyper-sensitive skin.

Initially, the skin became puffy and red, and the cream burned when I applied it. I've used others that have done this in the beginning, but once my skin got used to it, the reactions went away, so I took a day or two off from the Revive cream and then tried it again. WORSE reaction. The burning feeling upon application continued and all of the skin around my eyes started peeling like it was burned (lower lid, upper lid, and skin between upper lid and brow). I stopped using the cream at that time. I let the peeling go through its process and only used a previously-used non-irritating hydrating cream to help ease the discomfort/dryness (since the dryness was pulling at my lids and making my eyes dry). I thought my skin had finally returned to normal after about a week, but this was not the case. The burned/tight/peeling skin came back for round 2 (about 2.5-3 weeks after stopping usage of the Revive); I am hoping this is the last round of peeling because it's causing me to have dry eyes all the time (I have to use drops constantly), and also making having a professional appearance difficult at school/work. I know this product has seemed to work for many others; however, I would definitely not recommend trying this product based on my experience. ",1,0,12/15/2018

Moisturizing Renewal Cream,195,Ande Y.,5,,,,,,, New skin ," I have oily skin that is also dry in certain areas so it has always been a challenge finding a moisturizer that balances my skin. I have also been battling small but consistent break outs due to hormone changes since I hit my 30's. After I started using ReVive THE FIRST NIGHT my skin looked so much better. I felt a slight tingle putting it on which I didn't mind and a little goes a long way. By the end of the week I had no signs of a break out, my skin was soft and tight (yes, that is possible) and my boyfriend even noticed the change and told me my skin looked great! That's a miracle in my book and makes the price worth it. I work in the entertainment industry and get handed a good amount of products to try so I've become a bit of a skeptic. This cream will be sticking with me as long as it continues to work its magic. ",0,0,3/3/2016
