The nylon shredded and it did not seem safe so we had to take it away. On the plus side, the ball underneath the nylon was brightly decorated, so when I cut of the cover she still had a fun durable ball to play with. She seems to like the other toy as well; it keeps moving around the house. We were unable to give her any of the treats because they all include chick pea flour and one includes peanuts. One of my children has a history of anaphylaxis to these ingredients. They appear to be high quality treats, and the dog would probably like them, but not worth risking my kid's life to find out. We donated them. I knew there was a risk the treats would contain peanut, but I didn't expect the chick pea flour. I wish they would include ingredients with these product. I usually look them up when I buy dog treats. I bumped my review up because the company is amazing to work with, highly responsive and willing to customize boxes based on your needs. I might continue a subscription directly though bark box, but the generic box as sold through this site is unfortunately not a good fit for us.",8

He was left with a family member who traumatized him and he didn’t have toys of his own so I got him this as a quick solution when he came into my life not realizing Bark customer support would be able to help me customize a box specifically for his needs. The box arrived today and he immediately knew it was for him and grabbed the turkey barker first. He was so happy when I asked him to show it to me he lifted it up mid play for a quick picture. He’s a destroyer and he hasn’t even gotten passed the first layer. He’s so happy thanks Bark team!,4

The toys cost around $10-15 each and the treats range from $5-10 for each package, sometimes more. The extra treat they add in is usually a premium thing, from my experience, that can cost anywhere from $7-16 so if you add all this together the value is $37-66. I would say it was worth it for the value of the toys and treats you get. If your pup is chewing them to pieces, the Barkbox people offer a Super chewer box, you just need to email them! If your pup damages a toy or it becomes harmful to your pet, let Barkbox know and they will do what they can to rectify the situation. A previous review I read stated that one pup got injured by a defective toy, and was hospitalized. The owner contacted Barkbox and they paid for the vet bills as well as a new toy for the injured pup. It was that review that convinced me this was the best box for my pup. I don't have a super chewer that destroys toys in minutes but I can tell you my dog breaks squeakers so fast it is ridiculous. Not only do these squeakers still work after months of use, my dog still chooses them over other toys that we have gotten from our local pet stores. Barkbox toys are his favorite. I would have posted a picture but all the ones I took were blurry since my pup was so excited he was moving too fast. Thanks to everyone from Barkbox for putting these together!",10

I bought the small for my Jack Russell terrier and it fits perfectly in his 24 X 17 inch crate. As noted by other reviewers, I wish the seller had packed it in a flat box as it arrived with a big hump in the middle. I can understand why they might have to fold the larger sizes, but it would have been easy to ship the small in a flat box. Never the less, I put a heavy object on the hump and it went away in about an hour. It also inflated perfectly very quickly even with the weight on the hump. I chose the black window pain plaid only because it was the only one available without a furry surface - as I find those fake fur surfaces tend to get yukky fast and are hard to clean - but I was pleasantly surprised how nice looking it is. As always, I will put a soft washable blanket on top to make it cuddly for my boy. I bought this during Amazon Prime day but I intend to buy another at regular price for my other terrier's crate.",

You simply take it out of the package, take off the outer plastic and peel open the airtight sack. It'll them start blowing up like a Kardashian's booty. It does take a little while to air up though. For some, it can take up to 24 hours and for others you'll have to wait for 72 hours. Either way, you're going to be getting something your dogs gonna love sleeping on. Oh! I forgot to mention. It comes with a toy. So, your dog has a comfy place to sleep, and a little toy to play with for those times when he or she wakes up at night and has nothing else better to do. The covers machine washable. So you can take it off, toss it in your washer, and have it come out nice and fresh. Make sure you put it in the dryer though.

Now it's kind of a surprise when we _don't_ see him snoring away on this bed. As I said, he's 17 and arthritic, so the firm memory foam in this bed gives him better support than other options around the house. At only 3"" high (it ""looks"" smaller than that, but I haven't measured), it's easier for him to step on and off, too. Knock on wood, he hasn't had an accident yet (and I hope he never does!), so I can't speak to the waterproof aspect yet, but overall I'm happy with the bed... and more importantly, the dog is too. He seems to be genuinely comfortable on it, and I wasn't kidding about the snoring, either! My only complaints about the bed are nit-picky aesthetics. I ordered the sand color. What I received looks nothing like the photo. I received a hybrid... it has an espresso body with a sand top surface. I trust that's just a new style and not a factory second. In and of itself, it doesn't look bad at all, but there's a reason I ordered sand. My wife is the one who opened the package upon arrival, so I didn't get to see how it was packed; but based on the wrinkles on the bed cover, I'm guessing everything--gel foam, memory foam, and cover--were all vacuum-sealed together in one bag. The wrinkles are _not_ coming out over time and appear to be a permanent feature of the cover. Maybe they'll come out when the cover gets washed the first time? I hope so, because it doesn't look good right now. Since I shared my nit-picky complaints, let me be fair and praise one of the ""little details"" that drives me nuts when done wrong. The zipper to remove the cover runs length-wise, not width-wise, and even wraps around one of the corners, making it ultra easy to remove and reassemble the cover. Thank you! Alas, my dog has lost any enthusiasm for toys these days, but the ""pea"" would have been an enjoyment for him in earlier years, and a perfect size for him. It'll get donated to a local adoption agency where I'm sure it'll be enjoyed by many. As I've already stated, both the ""old man"" and I are quite happy with this bed. Offered at a fair price, too. UPDATE (8/13/2020) After writing the above review, I had to take measurements. The medium bed is 32""L x 22""W x 2.875""H, which is longer and wider than specified in the description. Be aware of that. If I had bought this item as a bed for a 30"" kennel, it would be too big. Thankfully, however, that wasn't my intent (though I used it as my basis for the purchase), so the larger dimensions are a bonus in my case. FINAL UPDATE (12/20/2020) 1. It took 5 washings (maybe six), but the wrinkles finally came out of the cover. The bed looks much nicer now. 2. Alas, the old dog had a few accidents on the bed since the original review; three of them to be exact. The cover was wet but the bed inside remained dry! The long, easy-on-easy-off zipper helped get the cover off quickly and in an orderly fashion. 3. Really happy with this bed, and love the extra firmness for my boy.",13

I got it because it came highly recommended, but if your dog is a scratcher, bitter, or chew, then don't waste your time of money. I literally have thrown my money away by buying this bed. This 1st one. I washed it in cold water and the clear cover in the inside got destroyed. The bed would collect the smells quickly and hard to remove hair. The 1st bed was purchased beginning of Jan. Out of nowhere, my dog decided he wants to chew the bed. It took him secs to take a bit of the corner and rip open the bed. No joke seconds!!!!! There was foam everywhere. At that mount I didn't think about how great this bed is for his hips. I thought how crappy the bed is. I decided to buy it again because I thought it was a one time thing that got into him. The 2nd took about 24hrs to inflate. I put it in his house the next morning. Close the house door and went to church. Within 5mins of us leaving, he started to chew. He destroyed the bed in seconds!!!!!. This new bed last mins compared to the other one that lasted 2-3 months.

I was expecting the same result when I received the BarkBox bed but he luckily loves it and I'm so happy he's more comfy now! I had a few requirements for his next dog bed and this bed checked all the boxes: 1. Lounger style dog bed with bolsters/raised edges as my dog likes to rest his bed on the bolsters and cuddle into them 2. Legit memory foam and not the cheaper egg crate stuff cause only the best for my spoiled dog! 3. Easy to disassemble and wash as dogs get dirty and they have accidents. His old dog bed is lumpy cause I had to wash it whole so I was looking for a bed where I can take the cushions out and just wash the cover. My dog loves the bolsters on this bed as they're well stuffed but also a bit mobile so he can push the bolsters out a bit to create more of a donut bed. My dog is about 27lbs and the medium is a great size for him. When he's curled he has some empty space but he can also stretch out and take up the whole bed. Although he can't provide any input on the memory foam, I'm pleased with the high quality foam/cooling gel and my dog looks extra comfortable (I'm jealous, I don't even have memory foam!). This dog bed is easy to disassemble/assemble and the cover zips right off when I need to wash it. The dog bed arrived disassembled but well packaged. I let the foam sit to regain its shape and there were no issues at all. The bolsters were easy to stuff into the cover and the overall assembly was straightforward. Bonus Points + neutral gray color that matches my decor and hides dirt + free toy! My dog was most excited about this when I opened the box and I loved the thoughtfulness of BarkBox in making the whole package ""Princess and the Pea"" themed since my dog is clearly a high maintenance prince Neutral Points - While the cover appears durable and water resistant, I doubt it is completely waterproof (which is fine in my situation as my dog is potty trained). The durable fabric can also be quite noisy when your dog gets in and does his circling before settling down. You can put a towel or blanket over the fabric if this bothers you. Tip if your dog is stubborn and doesn't use his great new bed - take a towel/blanket and drape it over his old dog bed. Leave it here for a few days while he uses it so the towel/blanket smells like him. Then change out the old dog bed for the new dog bed with the smelly towel/blanket on top. This was enough to trick my dog into using the new bed. You can take the towel/blanket away after a few days when he's used to the new bed. As a disclaimer, I received this dog bed for free with no obligation to review. I am reviewing because I'm so happy with this bed.",

I’ve spent the last 11 years trying every type of flat bed with sides only to find them thrown out from under the bed when I wake up or him actually sleeping under them. I even tried one of those donuts. He loved the donut but it didn’t fit under the bed and we have limited floor space in our studio apartment. As you can see from the photo, this is “the one.” It’s low profile fits right under my bed without me having to put risers on my bed frame that make me nervous about him sleeping under there. The open side is definitely what we’ve been looking for! He has the support and comfort of the sides but has the ability to easily get out from under the bed with the open side. The soft side isn’t overly plush like those donuts that get all matted in the wash. And it’s not an eyesore the outside even matches my chair at the end of my bed! It’s also the easiest bed I’ve ever had to take apart and wash. We’ve owned other barkshop beds that were easy to maintain (still 5 stars) they just weren’t the fit for under the bed. But I imagine this bed would be great just for general use There is absolutely no downside to buying this bed for our needs. I may buy a smaller size for travel. I ordered a LARGE he’s only a 19 lbs dog but he likes to stretch out as much as he likes to curl up so he has options with this size. He does like to dig in his bed so in a few months I may update with opinion on durability but my dog still has the first toy I bought him when he was a puppy, so digging and washing are the only way we can test durability.

Overall I feel like it was a great buy. I’ve had it now for a little over a year. The picture of the empty bed was just taken after I washed and dried it which I do monthly. It’s still just as stuffed and comfy looking than ever. (I don’t wash the stuffing obviously). As you can see in the other pictures it gets plenty of use by both of my dogs and the cat. It’s easy to wash/dry but is a bit of a pain to stuff the side pillows back in and zip up. The mattress cover (separate part) in my opinion has too small a zipper. It’s hard to hold and close. I also broke it very early on by pulling too hard and tore the stitching at the end. Luckily my MIL is a seamstress and new how to fix it. My jerk cat did also put some pulls in it very early on. It’s not bad material but certainly not meant for a cat to knead around endlessly to get comfy. If you’re a cat owner too I suggest keeping them off of it. The very thin plastic inside the cover which I assume is what makes it “water resistant” is also a little sketchy. It separated from the cover early on and has since kind of fallen apart through washing. That’s not a deal breaker but if that’s indeed the intended purpose of this plastic it isn’t that great. It may sound like a lot of negatives but this is indeed a great dog bed. The dogs (and cat) love it. It’s in my home office where they sit next to me every day. It may have some flaws, but the fact that it still looks this good this long after buying it is everything. Most dog beds look like garbage after the first year and most aren’t that much cheaper than this.",

First off, I want to thank BarkBox for sending this product to me for free during one of their promotions! I mean... I never get anything for free so receiving this for our brand new pup deserves 5 stars on its own. The Medium bed comes in a pretty good size box. It was packed tight and with care. There was a bag that was vacuumed sealed shut, the manuals, pea toy, and accommodating covers. I carefully took out the memory foam mattress pad and bumpers. I fluffed out the bumpers, but thought that was a waste once I spent more time than necessary inserting them into the zippered cover - This took me a while. I decided to do this before the mattress was ready because I thought it would have been easier. I managed to get them all in and zippered nicely... this part of the bed felt like such great quality already! It was on the heavier side and was weighted all around. I felt really good about it even though this step challenged my patience a little. Obviously, unfolding the mattress pad, there was a crease down the center... PER INSTRUCTIONS it states to wait 24-48 hours for it to completely inflate to the appropriate thickness. Well, I was patient and I waited and voila! NO CREASE OR BUMP down the center lol. (Complaints with this made me laugh) The instructions are pretty clear :) You can see the crease down the center in picture #3 &amp; #4, but then see a dramatic difference in pictures #4, #5, &amp; #6 (after 48 hours). There is zero bump, but there is a slight wrinkle on the upper memory foam. All sides seem to measure pretty consistent in height. Put the bed together and it looks amazing :) My pup loves it and also loves the Pea toy it came with. The squeaker in the toy isn't that great, but it's just one less thing to annoy me lol. I give this bed 5 Stars, hands down and I would purchase this again in a heartbeat!! It's superior quality! PSA: For those of you saying the bed lacks in quality because it's not ""Chew-Resistant""... I would suggest exercising your pups more and also supervising them if they are prone to destroying. I guarantee you, you won't be able to show me a dog bed that can withstand such abuse... this doesn't exist. This was one of the silliest complaints. Your dog destroying a terrific item has nothing to do with this company's quality. Update: Bed is still amazing. Puppy is using it everyday oh his own! It makes me so happy. I went ahead and purchased the Sherpa cover to have on hand when the other cover is being washed. Love the option of the different covers available for the memory foam pad. Thanks BarkBox!",202

I was a little hesitant at first given the price, but now I'm so glad I bought it. It fits on the floor between the driver and passenger seats perfectly, which is likely where our pup will sit (also harnessed/fastened in) when we bring her on the road with us. I let the pieces sit for 48 hrs to expand before I assembled the bed, and it was easy to put together. I haven't washed it yet, but the material seems very sturdy and is easy to wipe clean. My dog (45-50 lb lab mix) fits perfectly in the Medium with a little room to spare.. she loves this bed and knows it's her ""spot"". She did completely destroy the cute little pea toy that came with it, but no stuffed toy is safe around her haha. Even my cats loved this bed, so we'll likely be buying the Smalls for them at some point. If you're on the fence, just go for it! I don't think your pup will be disappointed :)",

Affordable and worth it!,"My Frenchie is middle aged now and has issues getting up stairs or higher platforms now. I'm glad I found this bed since the whole thing sits low to the floor, so he can just crawl into it or even roll off it safely. He also has to rest his chin often on low ridge like a sofa arm rest to keep his airways open for breathing. These ridges are just the right height and solid enough to support his chin. Other beds can be too low, too soft, or too high. For the price, this is easily worth a try and if you have a bulldog like me, the M size is a great fit for a 20-30 lbs Frenchie. I've read some other poor reviews, but I feel like they've failed to read the instructions that came with the bed.

It’s definitely a quality bed and the price was really reasonable. I’m glad it can be washed, although that will probably not happen for quite awhile.

Story time: I have a 22 pound 7 year old long haired doxie. He has always loved his bed and we have even rearranged the furniture set up in our home to give him his own alcove where his bed can lay. We’ve gone through 4 or 5 beds in his 7 years, with the most recent going out just a few weeks ago. Two weeks ago, he got too excited after eating and regurgitated all of his food right back into the bed he’s had for years. I tried everything to get it clean. Washing. Vinegar. Air drying. Everything. But sadly the bed wasn’t one that had a separate cover to be washed. My boy was heart broken and so was I. I went to amazon and thought I was doing something good by getting him a $30 cone insert orthopedic bed. (Because he’s 7 already and doxies are known for bad backs) He HATED this thing. He has never been a digger or a chewer in his entire life. Every time he tried to lay on it, he all but ripped it out of the spot and preferred the floor. So back to Amazon I went. We have been a subscriber of Barkbox for years and know how great they are, so when I found this bed I was VERY excited. And so was my boy! He LOVES this thing! He jumped in immediately the second it was put together and has been pulling all of his toys in with him. It’s so good to see him happy again. It was easy to assemble, came well packaged, and the foam insert only took about 2 hours tops to expand out. The crease was gone! It is very sturdy and heavy!

The quality of this bed is extremely nice for a giveaway, which just attests to what a great company they are overall. The bed came exactly when they said it would, in a bigger box than I expected, with everything vacuum sealed. Having bought many products that come like this, I knew that it usually takes 48 hours minimum for them to fluff up to full size. Sure enough, in 2 days the mattress pad was full &amp; flat, needing a bit of coaxing to get the cover fully zipped, but was still easy to get closed. The bolsters, however, were a different story. It's probably best if you have a helper for this part, as they are so fluffy, and need to be wedged into cover so tightly that it's definitely a struggle, especially taking care not to accidentally catch the bolster while zipping. All that bolster battling is fully worth it, as you'll see once you have an assembled bed. The bolsters create a super thick, cushiony pillow evenly around the entire bed. I was pleasantly surprised by just how thick &amp; tall they were (shown in pic #3 with height of pen for comparison). The bed looks bigger than I thought it would be, and the cushion is certainly thick and sturdy enough to use by itself. The cover material is not soft as in plush/fluffy, but is smooth to the touch and soft enough to provide good cushioning. You can tell by the feel that it is water resistant, though I haven't had to test that, thankfully. It washes very well, but as it's a chore to get bolsters back in, I'd recommend spot cleaning, or a blanket over it for easy cleaning.",

It arrived a few days after making it kinda crappy because I wanted my dog to have his own box to open; something that both of us could be surprised by. That didn't happen. My dog it a schnauzer, but he's only about 27 pounds. Per the listing, I bought him a box for medium dogs. I received 2 bags of dog treats and 2 toys. One toy, the Nutcracker, was very cute and is made to put treats into, however it's not durable at all. My dog ripped the stuffing out of the head before he was able to get a treat out! He's not a big chewer. He'll chew on something for a short time unless it's something like a dog bone or so. The second toy was the Walnut and while it was cute, it was far too big for him. It's a bit bigger than a grapefruit, slightly smaller than a honey dew melon. He won't even go after it if I throw it and when he does play with it, he get discouraged because of it's size. There are coupons in the box for a free first box which I'm not sure applies since technically I have already gotten my first box so... I find that a bit odd to include. I contacted customer service and they were willing to resolve the issue, they asked what my dog preferred and I gave them some insight. I mentioned that softer toys were better but more durable ones worked best since he likes to rip the stuffing out of things. They sent two more toys and a dog jerky chew. The chew was a bit hard but he likes it. The first replacement toy was the cute apple slices (1 pair). I thought they were going to be durable since the fabric was similar to what they made backpacks out of but in less than a day, one of them was destroyed. The second toy was a soft toy too which I haven't bothered to give to him because I know it'll get destroyed instantly. The treats he liked, I could have made a better Christmas box for him for less money and better quality. Even at half price, this wasn't worth getting. I'm only giving it two stars because of the good customer service and the treats.",One

The toys are the main focus for us for the bark box. Unfortunately, we have mixed feelings. The toys are very well made. Very good quality. Problem is they are too well made in that the stuffing/insides are too stiff. We have a whippet and tried both the medium as well as small toys (3 months worth). Both are too hard for the boy to bite/squeeze for the squeaky. We even have a hard time squeezing them. Thinking just an issue with that month, we tried another month. Due to timing of subscription of Amazon, then we did a subscription direct, we got 3 boxes in a two month span. After the 3rd box with same issue of toys being too hard, we checked with bark box and they sent us a small toy as trial. It was so hard to squeeze ourselves, not sure how they expect a dog to do so. Funny thing is we found a set of toys at Costco made by Bark box for them... These were soft, had multiple squeakers inside and great. Based on the 3 boxes we sampled, we will probably be cancelling our subscription. Great well made toys...just too well made when a dog can't squeeze/bite them to make them squeak.",

(See Pros and Cons),"I think this is a very good dog bed. Its better than what I thought Id receive but it has one big flaw. Its not waterproof anymore and Ill explain why. We purchased it November 30, 2020 so we have had it one month and four days. Here is the pros and cons. Pros: • The foam is as pictured, there is a top layer of foam thats blue. I have purchased other dog beds that supposedly had the blue top layer but once receiving it the foam didnt look as pictured. This one actually does. • We bought the extra large and its supposed to be for dogs up to 120lbs. We had a 121lb person stand evenly on it after it inflated for the appropriate amount of time and sure enough her feet didnt touch the floor underneath. The weight on a dog is spread out but even with all the weight being in her feet they still didnt touch the floor. Waiting the appropriate time for it to inflate does make a difference so its best to do. • Cover is easy to clean and does block out urine, unless it is barely damaged (see con). • The dog took to it really fast and really loves it. That in itself is a use Pro. Cons: • Only one con, but its pretty significant. The outer case is the waterproof cover. Unlike other beds where there is a second case underneath the outside cover and the second case is waterproof. (With those beds you only have to wash the outside case and wipe down the waterproof one thats the second case.) The nice thing about the outside cover on this bed being waterproof is the lining they used inside truly is waterproof, not some cheap thin cover. Downside is if anything, anything at all, damages the cover which is the only cover on this bed, urine will go straight to the foam. Be it the dogs claws, chewed, it being washed over time and breaking down, or cats, if there is damage there will be urine leaking onto the foam. That happened to us already, I found a couple teeny tiny (seriously tiny) holes in the top of the cover. Thats all it took and urine went right through when it used to sit on top. Luckily I had a waterproof toddler crib mattress encasement on the foam before it was in the original cover so it leaked onto that. Problem is that toddler crib cover was supposed to be a secondary waterproof protection for the foam, not its first one. So now I need another cover that comes with the bed or two toddler mattress covers but I dont think two layers of mattress covers will fit in the original cover and it zip. So Im trying to figure out what to do. Hope this helps and wish me luck on figuring out our solution.",4

VERY happy, this is exactly what I wanted!!","We had been using standard foam (about 1 in.) over egg crate foam which was OK, but I wanted a new ""proper"" bed for our approx. 10yo 14 lb. terrier with mild arthritis. I struggled to find the right size and shape for the crate she likes to sleep in that offered REAL memory foam. I took a chance that if I liked the bed, I'd cut it to size. That's exactly what I did, and it worked like a charm. It is nice and thick, wasn't too difficult to cut, and fits the crate like a glove. I'm very happy with the quality of the bed and memory foam - it's squishy on top but doesn't just sink when weight is applied. Bonus: Our dog LOVES the little pea squeaky toy that came with the bed. BTW, it puffed right up as advertised within the day but I gave it an extra day just in case. I wondered if the bend in the middle (came folded in half) was going to be permanent, but it has since smoothed down.",10

I have gone through several that were either too small or just a little too big to fit comfortably on top of my bed. My dog likes to stretch out and it has been a nightmare trying to find something that works. This bed has nice bolsters on all sides, it's completely enclosed, which he likes. The material is not as soft as I would like but I suppose that's what makes it so durable? Seems like it will stand up well to digging. I just put a blanket down inside it and (when he doesn't dig it up) it really helps. The memory foam is not super thick but it did fluff up a bit after a day, as did the fold in the middle from the way it was packaged. My dog seems really cozy and comfy in it and it's the closest to the ideal size that I was looking for that I could find (after HOURS UPON HOURS of looking) and overall, I'm really pleased so far. Update: it seems to really be growing on my pup! He's sleeping in it every night, which is a relief, bc he had been bouncing around to different spots all night for a while. I'm ecstatic to have my dog sleeping with me again! And this bed just makes SENSE - what I mean is that I've been trying forever to find a bed that he can stretch all the way out in without it being so big the other direction it doesn't fit on my bed. This is the ONLY one I've found that doesn't get longer as it gets wider. Square shapes don't work well on top of human beds.. I'm actually buying a second bed in large for this reason instead of the other beds I've been looking at. I don't want to mess with a good thing!",2

Cons: * Rough textured fabric - not soft. Please update this with a more softer cover. * Very hard to install even with the cushion aligned correctly. Will make your hands hurt with installing.

Recommendation: * Get it if your dog likes sleeping in beds or on your memory foam bed. * Get if your dog needs support. * Get if your dog needs an upgrade to their bed. * Great value at the time of this review. Suggestions to BARK: * Add cooling gel to the memory foam * Separate the zipper into compartments for each cushion, rather than trying to stuff 4 bolsters with one zipper and one compartment. * Change out the fabric (at least on the grey one I got) to a softer, more comfortable feeling cover. Perhaps cotton or microfiber? * Bolsters should have memory foam too &amp; cooling gel if possible. * Need more designs and color options. Pink perhaps?

The program does not require any review at all, so this review is entirely voluntary and my own unbiased opinion. My pup is 30 lbs and looks like a herding mix. She starts sleeping curled up in ball but then stretches out so she needed a bigger bed than what we had. While the description says a 70lbs Dog would fit, I’m a little skeptical, but I haven’t tested that out so don’t take my word for it. The bed’s mattress is pretty large but the bumpers are also large so they make the inner part of the bed smaller. It’s still plenty big enough for my girl, though. The cover seems nice and thick. We do cover it with a blanket because we think that will keep it in good shape and because our girl likes blankets. There is some assembly involved, but if that keeps some of the cost down, I’m all for it. Assembly didn’t take more than 15 minutes and I did it on my own. The mattress was already mostly inflated by the time it arrived and had reached full thickness within 30 minutes of being unboxed. It’s pretty thick, about 3”, which is really nice. Overall, the bed looks to be good quality and would have been a reasonable price even without the promotion. I’ve been looking at beds that cost $100-$150 so finding this was a real win for us.",

I was surprised at how heavy the box was when I received it. That said, I think it’s indicative of the quality of the memory foam and supportive elements of the bed since I don’t anticipate it will start sagging or sinking any time soon. In terms of assembly, I did break a sweat trying to zip up everything together because it was a super tight fit with the 4 cylinder sides. The instructions provided are very clear, the cylinders just seemed to be a little bit long, so when you’re finally on the last side, you kind of have to shove it in and zip it up for it to stay. However, I do like that you can deconstruct the whole thing so that it’s easier to wash in the long run. It’s not the softest outer material, but I think that it’s ultimately better for when you wash it in the washing machine (I haven’t yet though) since the softer materials typically get nasty or discolored over time. Plus, all we have to do is cover it with a softer blanket that we can wash more frequently than having to take the bed apart. For sizing reference, the medium sized bed is long enough and then some for my 12” 12lb maltipoo to lay out comfortably. But can’t imagine it’s long enough for any dog that’s longer than 15”-16”.",4

The bed itself seems very resilient with almost a jean like texture. With that being said, my pup likes soft things and wouldn't use it. I eventually took out the memory foam bottom and added a pillow in it's place and a soft blanket, once she got use to using it I replaced the pillow but kept the blanket and she seems to enjoy it now. For the medium bed, a standard pillow fits perfectly. Now she sleeps in it every night next to me instead of on me, which is nice for my sleep habits lol. Zipping it up was kind of hard to do, but I eventually got it. To do this regularly if I need to clean it will be pretty hard, but I feel most beds don't even have that option. My rating is based solely on the fact that my pup wasn't immediately thrilled and wouldn't use it as it but keeping in mind she does she in it now that I made it softer. Now for the promotion issues: After signing up for a promotional deal to get a free bed with a rebate that was suppose to happen 1-2 days after shipping, it took over a week and multiple contacts to get my money back. They eventually rebated me the money and made it up to me. Great customer service, but they really shouldn't promise things they can't deliver.",2

I bought the large, and it is just big enough for my 60lb Aussie mix. Thankfully he uses dog beds to curl up on to sleep in a ball and not to stretch out, or he wouldn't fit. It's fairly heavy and doesn't seem to slide around my wood floor like other dog beds do. There are some reviews where people complain about the mattress not puffing out right away, but you really do have to follow the instructions and wait 1-3 days for it to puff up and then it's perfect. I found it went faster when it was inside the house, rather than in the cold garage. The material seems very easy to clean and water/pet hair resistant, which is important to me. However, if you plan to put it in your own bedroom be aware that the material is a little bit loud against their feet when they move around on it. I keep this in the living room, so it's not a problem for me. Overall, I'm very happy and I hope it retains it's shape for a long time.",

All opinions are my own (and my dog, Ripley's!) This is packaged very well with clear, easy instructions. My set came with a plush toy pea and a crown, a cute play on ""the princess and the pea"". I let the memory foam inflate overnight, then zipped up the covers and bolsters and put the covered memory foam in the center. I slipped the pea under the bed. Ripley did not at first know what to do with the bed. She is used to a pillow style (and a human bed) so I think the bolsters confused her. We helped that out with some reward-based training. She did end up finding the pea, playing with it, and then curling up in the bed after. What a princess! The bed itself is very comfortable (yes I tested it) but the material is not. It's some sort of polyester mix, probably designed for easy cleaning. Ripley is 6 and bathroom messes aren't an issue, so she would have preferred something softer. However, that was an easy fix due to the design. We simply wrapped the mattress in a throw blanket she likes. It was easy to tuck the blanket so it fit tightly like a fitted sheet!

Full disclaimer. I did not buy this dog bed for my dog. I bought it for my cats. My cats are brothers from the same litter. They love to cuddle and sleep together. Most cat beds are not large enough to accommodate them both. So I decided to venture into the dog bed world. Another disclaimer, my cats are SPOILED. Just any dog bed would not suffice. I wanted one with a nice high lip (to keep cats contained as they like their royal bed to be placed high on a table) and I wanted the cover to be removable so it could be washed. This dog bed had everything I was looking for, along with great reviews so i decided to pull the trigger and try it. My cats LOVE this bed. After opening the package and “assembling” the bed (you have to stuff the pillow parts into the be fabric) and placing it on their bed table, they immediately started investigating. Once I added their favorite blankie, they laid down in the bed. My favorite thing about this bed is the quality. The pillows parts are very filled. Not those half filled pillows you see elsewhere. It made getting them into the zippered fabric a little difficult, but this is a good thing. You don't want some deflated looking dog bed. This thing is well stuffed. The fabric is also a great quality. It isn’t a cheap fuzzy/furry fabric. It feels like a nice thick, like the grandchild of upholstery fabric. This feels like it will definitely hold up to little claws jumping into it over and over again.",

We originally subscribed due to the promotion of 50% off the first box to see how we liked it. While everything in the box was good quality and the theme was very cute, we decided to cancel our subscription only because spending the regular price of $30 per month on treats, chews and toys is out of our desired spending for such items based on what you get in the box. We have a 15lb mini goldendoodle so the treats and toys will last for a couple months. Even still, $30 is a little high for what you get in the box in our opinion; $20 would be more reasonable; although it's understandable that the extra above $20 is likely shipping. It would be nice if you could change the cadence so that boxes came every other month or every quarter instead of every month. But over all, a great idea and good products for sure.",2

Really cute themes every month 2. Good variety of toys (nylon, rubber, etc) and you can customize how much of each kind you get by contacting customer service. You can also customize to have a ""toys only"" box if you aren't interested in treats 3. Great customer service in general 4. Good price for the number and quality of toys Cons: 1. Hard nylon toys should ONLY be given to puppies - that way if they crack a tooth it isn't a permanent one. As a general rule of thumb, if you can't make at least a small indent with your fingernail, it is too hard for adult teeth. They really shouldn't be encouraging people to give rock-hard nylon toys to adult dogs. 2. If you have a dog that is over 75 lbs then this is not the box for you. The toys in the ""large"" size box were on the small side for my GSD and are a full-on choking hazard for my mastiff. They should have an option for giant breeds or they should explicitly state that when they ask you for your dog's breed, that they aren't actually using that to choose the toy size - every dog in the large size box gets the same toys regardless of whether they are a 60 lb collie or a 200 pound mastiff. It's extremely misleading for them to ask what breed you have and then send everyone the same size toys anyway. 3. Their rubber toys are not nearly as heavy duty as kong or bullymake rubber toys. For true super chewers I would choose bullymake. I have both subscriptions and I find that while barkbox is okay for my GSD, the toys they provide are entirely unsafe, and not nearly durable enough, for my mastiff. Conclusion: I will keep getting this box for a couple of months because it has a nice selection of toys for my GSD and my smaller mixed-breed. However, they really should be offering a size up from the large box - I would say the toys in the large box would be more accurately described as being for medium-sized dogs like collies, smaller labs, and spaniels. The attached picture is of the rubber toy they sent after approximately 10 minutes with my mastiff (who isn't even full grown yet). The tail was ripped off by my GSD about 20 minutes after I took this picture. The whole things was in the garbage after about 45 minutes when I caught my mastiff eating pieces of the rubber. However, I will say that my experience with customer service was great and they sent out a replacement toy immediately, so no complaints there.",7

They have nice insulated dog houses with straw bedding to make our Midwest winters more bearable. I wanted to get them some kind of bed so they could be a little more comfortable on my cold wooden porch when they were out of their houses. I ideally wanted to find a true waterproof (or as close as I could get to one) outdoor pet bed and this one from Bark Box seemed to fit the bill and the price was very reasonable so I purchased it. It came fast, well packaged with a toy and a little paper crown. Too cute! (Gus Dog loved the pea toy but the crown not so much lol.) I opened the package and pulled out the bed and bed cover. The bed itself was folded, rolled then vacuum packed. When I unrolled it, it kept wanting to stay folded. After getting smart, I read the instructions and found that I needed to lay the bed out for 24 to 72 hours so it could reform back to its natural state. This is were it lost a star. After 72 hours, the bed still has a ridge from where it was folded in half. (The first photo was after 24 hours). I decided to put the cover on and see how it went. The cover is very nice, and super easy to get the bed pad into with a generous amount of space. The flap that covers the zipper is awesome. The zipper itself was easy to zip. The bump/ridge was less noticeable and I'll have to see if it goes down when it's used. As a side note, in the picture with the one cat, you can still see a hint of the bump/ridge next to Little Bit. I got the green cover and it's a great shade of green. After I got it all together, I cut the tags off the cover. I glanced at the tags as I was tossing them in the trash and this is where another star should be deducted. On this tag, it states to ""tell the cat to get it's own bed"". Huh? I bought is bed for cats. Granted the bed is listed as a ""pet bed"", but then goes on to describe the bed in canine terms. Ok, I can deal with that because I get the Bark Box name thing. After all, it's not Meow Box..... However.... no where in the listing description (doubled checked) does it say no cats.... that is only mentioned on a tag no one really reads. I refrained from taking a star down for this because there is alway a chance I missed some fine print some where and I get that this bed is marketed more for dog use. Anyway, over all the bed looks comfy, the cover looks waterproof or close enough to it and when I put the bed outside for the cats, it was immediately infested with two cats. Texas and Little Bit are happy so in the end that's all that matters.",6

The side bumpers are like a firm pillow and support my bassets spine and holds him in place well. Medium is sort of tight for him but i like that it provides support and he likes smooshing in the bed. Im glad its a medium. I woke my dog up when i put the bed together and had him come see it. Seriously he immediatly laid in the bed and went to sleep. Yes as a basset he sleeps all the time but hes also very stubborn and never does what i say but he really liked this bed and got right in.

The material is durable and although mine hasn't peed on it yet, it seems water-resistant. I like that the cushion comes out and the cover is washable if needed.

This bed has some weight to it so she is unable to flip it over, but she does scratch on it and hasn't ripped it yet. The scratching sound is a little annoying, but I think she likes the sound which is why she keeps doing it. I was expecting the inside of the bed to be a little larger, but its nice that the edges are raised so she can use them as pillows. The only reason why I am not giving it 5 stars is because I wish the bottom of the bed had some soft material on it. Since the cushion can come out, maybe make it two-sided with one side durable, and the other soft material. I just put a blanket or pillow down, but it would be nice to have the option.

I just wish that it was TRULY machine washable like advertised. Even after following the washing directions, the liner that makes the bed cover “water resistant” started to come off after 2 washes. The material that makes the bed cover water resistant seems kinda cheaply made in the first place, but I didn’t expect it to fall apart so quickly. Little upset by that. For how much this cost I’d expect better water resistant material and a sturdier support system rather than just cotton siding. Sometime December of 2021: Overall the bed was easy to put together, my dog loves the added support, and she loves the free toy it came with (the little ball in the photo she’s sleeping with cause of how much she loves it lol). The only complaint I have is the side of the bed aren’t as sturdy as I thought they’d be. My dog is able to push them out when she leans on the front and the back of the bed, but other than than it’s a great bed. Very nice and sturdy material. I hate how much it costs, but it’s worth it. My dog is a catahoula and labrador mix and weighs around 60 some pounds. I got a large bed for her so she has room to stretch if she needs. Hope this review helps.",

If you have cats that like to sleep together, I'd go to the medium size. Pros: -thickness of mattress: as advertised. I wasn't sure when I opened it, but after laying out the mattress and then inserting it in the pillow, it is plenty thick. I think it helps that the mattress cover is pretty tight to cover it, so no room for it to go flat. -The material actually seems to repel hair. It's not soft and luxurious, but it will last for a long time. To add a little softness and so I could cover the pet heating pad I also use, I purchased the mattress pad which is soft and fluffy.

My old lady, Amber, is 12 and I just want her to live her best life! She had a fairly large orthopedic dog bed but she would always squeeze her big ole self in the smaller dog bed you see in the pictures below...which belongs to my mini schnauzer, Roxy. I finally realized she liked the high wall around the bed ..she likes to feel snuggled I guess. So after my research I decided to go with this bed because the reviews were great and the things people complained about were minute...""the cushions don't slide it easily""...In my eyes anyway. Also it was the bed with the highest wall around it and it is waterproof...jackpot! I received the bed gave it a few days to completely expand and set it up. Needless to say has not gotten into Roxy bed at all..not even once. On the contrary Roxy gets into her bed whenever she can! So here I am ...about to purchase the smaller one for Roxy ...they should both be snuggled at all times!! See pics below. Amber is about 70lbs and that is a medium bed. Roxy is about 17lbs.",

He’s a mixed breed of an American Staffordshire Terrier, German Shepherd, Husky, and Labrador Retriever so he is BIG (at 105 lbs and is eye to eye with mom when standing on his back legs - she is 5’ft) and loves to destroy toys. He is also a big cuddler and loves blankets and pillows. We were worried that he was going to immediately tear up this bed once it was put together, but he hasn’t tried to destroy it at all! The material is durable so when he does play bite it, it doesn’t rip or tear. We spent a couple of days training him to lay on it, and added his toys and favorite blankets around it. Now he sometimes leaves the family room with all of us just to come into the office to nap in it! It’s right by our desk, so he knows now to lay down once mom or dad start working on the computer. You can tell he is very comfortable, too, (I think it’s because of the bolsters) because he knocks RIGHT out once he’s laying on there! I totally would recommend! We’ve had it for a month now.",

There wasn't enough room for my boyfriend, dog, and me in the bed, so I decided to look for an equally comfy dog bed for Mason to sleep in when my BF was over. This worked, and it worked so well that Mason still sometimes prefers his own bed to sleeping with me, even when it's just to 2 of us. He was eager to jump in, even before it was all ready to go. As you can see in my photo, the mattress expands just fine if you leave it the amount of time the directions say (which I believe was 6+ hours). I love that you can remove the cushions and wash the cover. I will echo what another person said... It's loud if your dog moves a lot or digs or circles for the entire night, BUT that's the price you're going to pay for high-quality scratch/chew resistant material that's still ""soft"". Mason also thoroughly enjoyed the pea toy that came with the bed. So much so that he still has it and didn't destroy it to reach the squeaker and stuffing.",

I let the memory foam rise for about 7 days but the ridge never went away. I needed the bed for my dog’s crate, so I reassembled it and gave it another shot. Two months later, the ridge has been flattened by my dog lying on it. The memory foam never reached the listed height, but the dogs seem to like it now that the ridge has been flattened. I do like how easy it is to wash! Unfortunately I wasn’t satisfied with this bed. I read a few reviews that mentioned a ridge down the middle due to the shipping method, but I have always had a great experience with Barkbox so I hoped it was not a consistent issue. I have been letting the memory foam rise for 4 days now and there is still a prominent ridge. I believe the foam was stated to be 3 inches in height—only the ridge in the center is 3 inches tall. The rest hasn’t risen passed 2 inches. A few hours ago I tried constructing the bed anyway to see if at least my dog would like it, but he’s bothered by the ridge and will continuously lie down, stand up, nudge the ridge, scratch it, repeat. A little funny given the pea toy included with the bed. I’d advise against ordering this bed unless they change their packaging method (memory foam comes vacuum sealed, which is fine, but it’s also folded in half which causes the ridge). I’ve taken apart the bed and will let it sit out for a few more days to see if it ever corrects. If it does, I’ll change my review. I think it would’ve been a great bed if it weren’t for such a prominent ridge down the center",

Originally 5 stars, remains 5 stars. If I could give it more at this point I would. This was for a 30 pound herding dog for inside her crate. She's not all together destructive, however I will make note for you it has held up against her 'digging' at it on rare occasions. The pictures provided are after a couple of years and honestly, it's held up I think it will last for years at least. This item is shipped vacuumed sealed, so be prepared to let it flatten out a bit, shouldn't take more than a day or two to fully flatten, but useable enough right away if you're impatient. Overall, it is very lightweight, can't be more than 2 pounds. The cover is water-RESISTANT, not water-PROOF, however since she 'dug' at it, you can see some of that resistance is inherently gone. That said, the cover washes up extremely well, even through a few accidents. Taking the cover off is extremely simple, the zipper on the bottom runs along one long and one short side so you don't have to shimmy it out awkwardly of one end only. Now, I have heard if you want just a replacement cover, BarkBox no longer makes them/sells them for separate use. You can, however, look up Chinchilla Dog Bed Removable Cover and you should find one for your size. The Memory Foam is genuine Memory Foam, it is not cheap stuff or 'egg-crates'. My size dimensions were accurate to the description, although I will note if you are concerned about getting yours as being slightly larger than your crate allows, it will give enough as long as you are probably within 2 inches in order to fit appropriately. Please note it is only 3"" high but supportive enough for most medium dog needs. It does have a 'cooling gel memory foam' which is a little cool to the touch, but that wasn't my main draw.",2

It provides a comfortable place for my puppy to sleep, that isn't just the hard floor. The cover does come off very easily to clean, as well. Due to being memory foam, it comes squished down, and needs a day to puff up to its full size. The cons for this dog bed, are the fact that the zipper is too easily found for a curious puppy, even with a flap over the zipper, and easily opened and chewed thru to get to the memory foam. Eating memory foam is not like eating regular dog bed stuffing, it causes vomiting and diarrhea, and potentially worse issues if not caught early enough. This bed might be best for non chewers, or dogs being supervised during use. My dog always has a variety of chew toys while in her crate, but the shiny zipper was too appealing. Maybe an update to this bed would be a better disguise for the zipper.",2

I let it sit outside at night to dry in the warm air and it was ready to use in the morning. It's a great travel bed. The only thing I recommend is if you're dog is laying on it during a car ride maybe put something on top that they can grip. My guy doesn't seem to Grip well and ends up sliding, so i put a small rug (with grippy bottom) ontop of the bed and he travelled better on it. When we are home and outside he does prefer to lay on the grass or dirt, but camping he spends most time on the bed. After sleeping on it during the night he isn't as stiff in his joints as he is on regular padded dog beds.

She pees on anything she sits or lays on, many times when she is even unconscious and asleep. In the last six months we have had to throw out 4 dog beds that we could no longer get the urine smell or stains out of. I bought other dog beds that claimed to be waterproof but they all still absorbed and retained the urine scent and stains. This bed is so much easier to clean. I don't have to unwrap the whole thing and wash the cover, which on other dog beds ended up destroying the ""waterproof"" membrane on the bed covers. With this bed, when she has an accident, I can step outside and hose it off. A few minutes in the sun and it's clean and dry. As extra protection we put a towel underneath the bed and a water resistant blanket for comfort on top. The blue cover does absorb liquid rather than it beading off, but being able to just rinse it off with the hose is really helpful. I don't think there's a perfectly ""waterproof"" dog bed anywhere, but this one is the best I've come by and has definitely helped make this painful, sad, and stressful situation with our baby just a little bit easier. Will probably buy a second one so I have a dry one at all times. Also, it comes with an adorable ""princess and the pea"" theme. There's a paper crown and a green ""pea"" squeaky dog toy that come included, which are adorable.",58

Memory foam is great, just takes time to expand","This dog bed is awesome! My 40-lb labradoodle jumped into the bed as soon as I assmebled it, and it has been hard to convince him to leave it since! I got the large size because my dog likes to sleep with his legs stretched out instead of curled up. I was concerned that the tall bolsters might prevent him from stretching out, but as you can see, he was very comfortable and this was not a problem at all. :) Other reviewers have mentioned the memory foam being lumpy or thin. While it seemed this way at first, it just needed time...after about 24 hours of sitting out, the foam layer fully expanded into a plush, soft, completely flat rectangle. It seemed every bit as high-quality and supportive as the product listing claimed. So don't worry if your foam layer seems wrinkled at first, as long as you follow the instructions and let it fully inflate, it will be great. The only slight con about this bed is that the fabric is very noisy, as another reviewer mentioned, whenever the dog scratches it or shuffles around during the night. It's not a very big deal, but if they ever came out with a softer fabric replacement cover, I would definitely be interested in purchasing it. Overall, this seems like a great quality bed. Most importantly, my dog is very happy -- he keeps rolling around in it with sheer delight!",

My first impression is that it’s heavier than most dog beds, which I like. When my dog digs in it before she lays down, it remains in place. As I was putting it together I could see that it is well constructed. The fabric is sturdy, the zippers are hidden and the bed and bolsters seem thick and have just the right amount of firmness. I appreciate the water resistant layer on the mattress cover. My dog has occasional incontinence, so while she hasn’t had an accident on it yet, I’m hoping this feature will keep the mattress clean, hygenic and odor free. It was easy to put together and the pad decompressed quickly. Both the dog it was intended for and my other dog like laying in it. Minor cons - the fabric is a little “loud”. When my dog shifts her weight at night I can really hear her nails against this fabric. I can’t complain though because I think this fabric will last longer than say, a fleece fabric. Also, I think it will be a little time consuming to wash and put back together, as opposed to cheaper beds.",

But worth it.,"This is an amendment to my initial review. My hubs didn't have ant trouble placing and zipping the bolsters in place. Now that it's together, it's a pretty nice bed. After a weigh-in at a vet appt, my puppy is 30 pounds -- not 23 as I estimated from an earlier vet visit. He's not too big for the bed if he's curled up, he just can't stretch out. That's what the couch is for. It's a good looking, nicely cushioned bed. There's nothing soft or plush about this dog bed. The fabric is a type of denim with no ""give,"" making it difficult to assemble. Trying to stuff the bolsters and zip them is an aerobic exercise in frustration. I'm still trying to get the bolsters zipped in. I bought the small size for my 23-pound dog and from the looks of it, I should have bought a medium. I guess it will be ok if he sleeps curled up because there won't be room for him to stretch out. I'm really disappointed and frustrated with this bed.",4

More importantly, our pooch absolutely loves it. We have a 70 lb. German Shepherd and it fits him perfectly (Large size). If he were say 10-15 lbs larger it may be a bit snug though, so buyers beware. This bed is clean, sleek, sturdy, and comfortable for our dog. If you're looking for the side pillows to be completely, structurally sound for the aesthetic, this is not that bed since they do smush out to the side a bit. But it doesn't bother us and our Koda loves that the pillows are flexible. One more side note/ sort of ""con"" that in no way affects the quality of the bed, is that if your dog likes to dig, this might not be the best bed for you if your dog isn't trained. The bed insert allows for toys to get stuck under the pillows and your dog will dig/play to retrieve them. So if you're sleeping, it isn't super pleasant to hear. But after some quick training, that problem was ameliorated with us and we have found the perfect bed for our dog!!

In return for the promotion I am writing this review. Overall, I am satisfied with bed. When it first came, it came in an air decompressed wrapper that was easily unwrapped. It took about several hours for it to completely inflate. It is made from memory foam. However, when it first came, the foam was uneven and had a portion that was elevated in the middle.

I got a large and I have a somewhat undersized golden retriever (60lbs), and she barely fits on it. So if you have a golden or any large breed dog, you have to go for the x-large. The bed appears to be chew resistant to this point. Although my pup has not chewed on it too many times since every time she tries, we stop her. Because of this, we cannot accurately comment on just how chew proof it really is. We also have not tried to clean it, but we can say that the outer layer seems quite easy to remove, so we will update once we wash the outer layer.

My boxer/pit enjoyed both toys with one lasting a week and the other still lasting for the most part (2+months). The treats were enjoyed by both my dogs.

He’s a large breed mix puppy. After the first night we decided to cover it with a fleece blanket, as the slick outdoor-upholstery-type cover made scratchy noises every time he moved in his sleep. He moved out of it and chose the carpet halfway through the night. Once we put the blacker on it, he loves it; he was used to a plush bed before. If your pet is used to a plush feel, he may not like this cooler/smoother surface. I think they offer a plush bed too, but the colors didn’t work for me. My only gripe is that the outer bolsters quickly shapes into a bent over position if the dog lies on it, hanging his face and paws out of the bed, as ours does. To be expected, I suppose, but it affects the look.",

This bed is in my office under my desk and mind you my dog is a Belgian Malinois and she never leaves my side. However, ever since I got this bed if I'm out in the living room she will leave my side to go sleep on this bed in the office even though she has another bed out in the living room.

He loved it. Now that we're on the road though, he won't touch it, cause he loves/respects/fears Princess. Hopefully he'll get over it, realize it's for him, and get back to using it.

I found this on Amazon and because of price and because it was Barkbox, I purchased for her for since it was this the right size for kennel, I purchased. The first time I left her alone, she was able to separate the zipper (didn't tear, it just opened) which I had seen in a previous review and then tore up the foam. I was able to zip back and turn to other side of cage, but then she ripped that up as well. I will say that I didn't contact Barkbox immediately, but when I did, they said too bad so sad basically. I sent these same pics with my complaint and yet they asked for pics (???). And then said that their Satisfaction Guarantee didn't cover chewing. Here is my complaint - I purchased this bed for an 10 week old puppy. She split the zipper and tore up one side of the foam. I fixed the zipper and was able to cover the whole. The next time I put her in the cage with it, she tore open the other side and ripped out the foam. I am still using it for now but I have to wrap a beach towel around it so she can tear it up anymore. I purchased a $15 bed from PetSmart and my puppy drags it around, digs at it and chews on it and not even a hole. I should've reached out sooner, but I have had a crazy month. I saw you have a satisfaction policy, so I was curious if it would cover this issue. Please let me know. Thank you, Julie I was only able to attach 2 pics. Here is their reply - Fatima (BARK) Jun 4, 2021, 1:03 EDT Hi there, Julie &amp; pup! This is Fatima and my pup, Cookie, with BARK’s Amazon Team! Thank you for reaching out! How are you and your pup doing today? I am so sorry to hear that this happened. We designed our bed with the zipper at the bottom to help discourage chewing, but our bed is not chew proof. But I would certainly love to learn more about this! Was it just the zipper that was torn? Or was the cover torn as well? Also, is the memory foam damaged at all? Our warranty does not cover beds that have been chewed or torn by pups. I am so sorry for any disappointment with that. We are currently working on replacement covers to help in situations such as this! As for the bed cover, I can certainly help with this! At this time, we do not sell bed cover replacements for our dog beds. I am so sorry for any disappointment with this. If you would like to be notified if our replacement covers become available, I can certainly add you to our list to be notified if those are stocked up! What do you think of this? Just let us know and we will get you added. 😊 If you would like to go another route in the meantime, other customers, and some of our own team members, have used crib mattress covers for their beds! Please let me know if there is anything else that I could do to help out!

My rabbit loves to sit on this couch daily and routinely. She likes to lick the soft short fur on the cover. Sorry for the dirty cover picture, but as you can see the texture of the cover catches fur. As you can tell from my pictures, NObunny has put holes in it (that's surprised me). The memory foam pad beneath the zippable cover isn't washable, because it's memory foam, and hasn't gotten soiled whatsoever due to the waterproof nature of the cover. The orthopedic cushion does seem to help the bunny with feet and leg pain. It's firm, without noticeable give: this keeps bunny sturdy on her legs, but soft on her feet. I noticed some of the reviews for this product showed pictures of it being soft, creased and lumpy; this was not my experience at all. I got the medium and grey option, so I'm confused if the company changed its product, or if the reviewers washed the memory foam accidentally. Mine can't get lumpy or creased because it's about 3-4 inches thick and a super firm mattress. I can't easily bend the mattress. Back to the review: Bunny doesn't want to urinate on this item or chew on it, unlike her other bedding, for some reason; it could be due to the slick surface and texture of the cover. Bunny's can't digest hair and are unable to vomit hairballs, so they lick the hair on their tongue off onto fabrics or surfaces. I've returned many pet bed items for their false claims of being waterproof. I don't usually give full 5-star reviews, but this product has completely earned it.",3

TITLE IS A LIE. Not large, not memory foam.","I bought 2 of the ""memory foam"" ""large beds"". LIE LIE LIE the bed is NOT large nor is it TRUE memory foam and it's completely inappropriate for a geriatric dog or dog with arthritis or other joint issues. Below is the ACCURATE size of dog breeds and the standard US size for large breed crates. I've put medium, and XL as well so you can see larger dogs are not large dogs. A LARGE breed dog is a Weimaraner, Bullmastiff, Labrador Retriever, Golden Retriever, German Shepard, etc. A LARGE breed dog uses a 40' - 46' crate. A MEDIUM breed dog is a Border Collie, Basset Hound, Brittany, Springer Spaniel, Wheaton Terrier, etc. A MEDIUM breed dog uses a 36"" crate (unless your medium dog is on the smaller side for the breed. AN EXTRA LARGE breed dog (a Neapolitan Mastiff, Leonberger, Great Dane, Greater Swiss Mountain Dog,d AN EXTRA LARGE uses a 42-48""' crate. AN EXTRA EXTRA LARGE breed (Great Pyrenees, Irish Wolfhound, Leonberger, Neopolitan Mastiff, Great Dane, Newfoundland, Scottish Deerhound) uses a 60-72"" crate. These MEDIUMat all. These will NOT be used and I spent $80. RIP OFF. The measurements are not correct but close enough, however they are the finer print. I usually pay close attention to those but did not this time Im thinking. I trusted the bed was LARGE. Standard crate width is typically 36"". The bed is 35"" making it slide in any Med-Xtra large crate. The Customer thinks the bed is Large. It's not. Going back to look, the measurements are correct but that is no excuse for titling an item what it is not. One will assume the bed is Large. Those measurements are for a medium dog so the listing itself is a miscasting. The customer believes it's memory foam. It's not. Memory foam is a very dense, heavy foam which allows ""sinking in"", but has enough density to offer support so it doesn't swish flat under a dog. The paper inside says to leave the bed out 48 hours or more. Mine were full size in maybe 6 hours. That is because the foam is so lightweight and airy, it needs very little time to expand. I decided to test the bed foam by having my Labrador 6' puppy lay on it. she's 38 lbs. The foam squishes down to the ground. My cheap beds provide more cushion that this ""memory foam"" mattress does. Also what does ""PLATFORM"" mean? It suggests the foam is thick when it's not. PLEASE DON'T NOT USE THIS CHEAP, BED FOR OLDER DOGS WITH JOINT ISSUES.!!!!! The listing specifically says it's good for dogs with joint issues, ie arthritis. As the owner of two geriatric LARGE breed Labradors, the fake memory foam would offer visually no support or cushion. Maybe for a little dog up to 30 lbs. But in no way appropriate for a heavy dog which arthritis or other joint issues. Don't put your dog on this bed thinking they are comfortable. I made my own beds for now. Get this, I I have a 2"" memory foam bed topper. The FAKE memory foam beds I bought are 3"". My REAL memory foam is heavy &amp; dense. The dogs don't hit the floor. I cut it to size and put sheets around them for now. My old dogs don't sink down to the floor and my real memory foam was the cheap kind from Target. It's still 3x heavier. I have another memory foam fed for my 3rd older Lab. It's very good. It's large enough for her and supports her.. I didn't open these due to covid lockdown while out of town. I just got back 3 days ago and opened them. They tell you to wait for it to expand. You don't need to wait long. It't FAKE memory foam and is light and spacey so it expands quickly. Within 2 hours. This order is very disappointing. It's misleading at best, an outright lie with the foam. IIm going to call for a refund but it's past the date now. Hoping they'll be good about it as I'm a long time very good customer. If you like this bed, the size worked for you, meaning your dog is a smaller than what you believe the size to be. The title is a lie. The best is not a large. The bed is not memory foam. PERIOD.",3

Messes have happened on them, and they come out great from the washer/dryer. Unfortunately as all things don't last forever, the leakproof lining on the inside of the cover has suffered stress cracks all over. So it's not really liquid proof anymore. But that's understandable since the bed has been used pretty heavily by the big guy. My more recent xlarge did have some foam that took weeks to rise completely, not days.

The mess sat for a little while because I had to clean the puppies up and I'm not sure when the accident happened exactly. I was so amazed that nothing soaked thru to the mattress itself!! I cleaned the mattress cover and removed everything I could and then thru it in the wash. I washed it on HOT twice just to make sure nothing was left in the machine. I used a little Resolve Carpet Cleaner ( yes on stains in laundry) Persil and Clorox. I thought the cover would shrink and come out heavily stained and/or bleached out. Again.....

Do recommend.,"UPDATE: 8 months of 100% outdoor time use and I have some tips. The waterproofing did wear off and the bed got soaked. I used tent seam sealer and resealed all the stitched areas of the bed, inside and out. Also used trash bags to encase the pillow and duct taped where the two bags met. I haven’t had the slightest issues with it since. Looking back, I’d immediately bag and tape the pillow because once it does get wet it takes a while to dry back out. Still recommend it though. Not tears or fraying seams and the dogs use it daily. This is the Large size in red and a 50 pound Aussie on it for a visual. It’s looking like it will be a great outdoor bed. It really did puff up to the advertised 3” thickness and is dense enough that when the dogs lay on it, it doesn’t just compress under them. As one reviewer said, the material is kind of of “loud” but it’s a waterproof outdoor bed cover so that should be expected. Water spilled on it beaded or ran right off and the cover feels very durable even in the seams and zipper area. I’d definitely recommend this.",6

I saw the packaging so had to take pictures LOL. They packed a little stuffed squeaky ball which was a surprise and she grabbed it and started running around. The directions say to get your dog to help but you may want to skip that part. She kept standing on the bed while was trying to make it. I took a picture of her helpful feet. Later realized I also got a picture of the zipper. I was looking for the zipper and couldn’t find it. I thought it was piping. But it’s a really smooth zipper. Maybe because it is waterproof? My big girl can’t always hold her urine and when the meds don’t work it is bad. She has lost all her bedding :( Hoping the waterproof cover will finally help with a solution. The toy they tucked in is cute and she is currently carrying it around like a prize but when she decides this is a play toy I don’t expect it to last long. We get the BarkBox extreme chew toys for her but this looks like a cute toy not meant to withstand punishment. The box also had a freaking crown! She is a bit big for it but she tolerated it for pictures.,44

We especially appreciate how intentional Bark Box is with their designs: each toy has multiple elements to it (like crinkle, squeakers, fur, and tug ropes all in one toy for example), the packaging makes it easy to cut tags off, and we’ve put many of these toys through our washer and dryer over the months and they’re still going strong.

Put it in our chihuahua's wire crate that is 24""x17"" at the base. Not only does she love it, but the other dogs and 2 of the cats all were taking turns in the crate. We bought 2 more for the other crates of the same size (size small bed). Now they all rotated between the 3 crates. Then I decided to get a size large bed for on top of the 2 crates we keep put together, as that is where our 20 year old cat likes to spend his time. Now our 14 year old tuxedo cat, who recently survived being mauled by stray dogs, is also hanging out on top. We have 3 dogs and 3 cats, and they are all ecstatic with these beds. They are all considered senior animals, all were rescues. They clearly adore these beds. Couple things. We open it up, leave it unzipped, then let sit for 72 hours. People complaining it didn't expand in 30 minutes aren't reading the instructions. By giving it the full 72 hours on a flat surface, the bed can fully expand, and we are very happy with the results. We feed the dogs separately in their crates, so we use a piece of towel under their bowls. This is keeping the beds clean. Our chi, who used to start barking when she was done with her feed, now just rests calmly until we come to let her out. All of our animals are attracted to and completely enjoy these beds.",3

Although I had high expectations due to the positive brand reputation and appealing advertising, I discovered that the reality lacked in strength and durability. Within mere minutes of interaction, my dog, who by no means is an aggressive chewer, managed to tear the toy to shreds. The dog rope toy, which was supposed to withstand robust play, showed immediate signs of degradation. After no more than a few tugs, the toy was in complete shambles, a far cry from the toughness it purported. This raises considerable concern about the toy's safety. While a certain amount of wear and tear is expected, the fact that the Dog Rope Toy was destroyed so quickly doesn't bode well for its safety standards. The swift annihilation of this toy could lead to the spontaneity of sharp piece exposure, posing danger for our pets. For the price I paid, I anticipated a substantially more resilient product that could outlast the rough-and-tumble play sessions common in a dog's day. Instead, I was left with fragments of a toy that reflected severe shortcomings in durability. The BarkBox Dog Rope Toy severely under-performed and fell drastically short of the expectations set by the company's marketing promises. In conclusion, if you're in search of a robust, lasting toy for your dog companion, I regretfully cannot recommend the BarkBox Dog Rope Toy. Despite the appealing exterior, the product fails to deliver when it comes to endurance and durability, making it a disappointing purchase. For the sake of your canine friend, I suggest exploring other toys that prioritize safety and long-lasting performance.",

AMAZING Customer Service!,"We absolutely love Barkbox. We have a monthly toy subscription for our 1 year old Super Power Chewer pit mix. I originally ordered an XL bed for my senior lab mix who was born with hip dysplasia. I was worried about how “water resistant” the bed was, so I chatted with a customer service rep from Barkbox and asked if a pee pad would fit inside the cover of the bed. The reps took the time to look into measurements and assured me that they will take care of any questions or issues with the bed if they arise even though I was buying on Amazon. I ordered washable pee pads and they fit inside perfectly, no problem zipping the cover closed. Our senior dog LOVES, the bed. The XL is the perfect size for him - 85 lb. lab mixed with some big breed. A few weeks later our pit mix baby had to have knee surgery and must be confined to her pen. I ordered a Medium for her travel pen and a large for her big, metal pen. I put washable pee pads inside both. Medium is the perfect size for her - long body and 32 lbs. If you have ever had the privilege of speaking to one of their customer service reps, you understand when I say that they are amazing and will do absolutely everything they can to correct, replace, and individualize their products and services.",2

She seems to like it. I have a 65lb Rhodesian ridgeback and the XL was a great fit for her. The XL fit our standard XL kennel size perfectly (to the T!) and measurements were accurate. Followed the directions and let it expand before use. After 24 hours, it was fully expanded to the advertised thickness (measured with a ruler). My dog sleeps on it all day every day and it holds it’s shape very well. One night, my poor dog threw up on her bed and the waterproof lining protected the mattress well. I was able to wash the lining without a problem and slip it back on to be as good as new. I’m happy I didn’t have to wash the whole bed and could just slip the cover off. The bed lining is on the thinner side but once it’s over the bed, it doesn’t seem to be a problem. Hopefully it lasts multiple washes since it’s thinner, something to think about. There is a non skid bottom and the top is a sort of velvet lining which may be a concern on hotter nights. Otherwise I do recommend the product, it holds up to its name and the customer service absolutely cant be beat. Bark has been a reputable company and that’s why I chose their bed. They did answer questions and issues I ran into so they get five stars there as well. Overall, a safe buy. Update: lowered to three stars. It’s only been a month and I only hand wash the covering. this is only the second wash and I already found a hole in the thin lining. My dog is not rough on her bed. The liner is not practical and did not last a month of regular use and two hand washes. Contacted customer service and all they said was that I could use a baby crib covering. There are no replacement covers available. Good supportive mattress but weak covering that won’t even last a month.",

Its is shrink wrapped so you will need to allow about 48 hours for it to reach it's full thickness. There was a huge crease down the middle when I first opened it that had me nervous but after 48hrs it was completely gone. I ordered the large for my GSD that is just turned one. She is on the small side and is only 54 lbs. I feel it runs a tad small O should have gotten the XL. However this will still work perfect for what I attended to use it for. I wanted something that I could easily move from room to room with us and she could relax while still be close (she has separation anxiety) and be able to eat her messy treats and bones on. I dont like her laying on the floor since GSD are prone to hip and joint problems. The memory foam is very comfortable and light weight. The cover is easily removed and washable so this is great. The cover is also soft. As far as chew proof I wouldn't really know because my girl doesn't chew things she isnt suppose too but I would imagine if your dog has shredded beds this wouldnt be for you since it's just memory foam and fabric cover. She does grab it and move it around with no damage. Overall I really like this bed just pay close attention to the measurements and size to make sure you get the one best suited for your needs.,

Stuffing for each of the bolsters is separate and will need to be inserted into the cover. At first, they seem a bit large to fit into the cover, but this is exactly what gives the sides their firmness. The outside zipper makes it easy to gain access to the inside of the cover where the bolsters are inserted. The fabric is easy to clean. My only word of caution is about the lack of softness. The bed, while well made, it is rigid. The fabric is not soft. Some dogs may prefer this, while others may want something more plush. A towel or soft blanket can alleviate some of this issue.

He is a little squished in it with the walls but I need him to also not fall out of bed. Yesterday he was sleeping in his bed and apparently he could not get up because he super soaked his bed!

Writing a review isn't required but I see a lot of wildly different reviews so I figured I would write one. To start, I thought this was a crate sized bed, because apparently I can't read. It is not crate sized! In large it is about as wide as a standard doorway. We have a 75+lb 8 year old pit/lab and a 55lb 18 month street rat, both 22"" at the shoulder and 23"" inches long from shoulder to base of tail; they both fit on it individually just fine. They both kind of fit on it together when they decided to wrestle over it. Expanded to the proper size within a few minutes and after maybe an hour or so the center ridge was mostly smoothed out. Cover zips on and off easily, isn't anything really special, isn't hideous which is a plus in pet furniture. I tried laying on it and it is relatively cushy. The free gifts are PRETTY CUTE. I will say for the price it is a little bit expensive, but I feel that way about most dog beds and try to buy them on sale or clearance for that reason. Since it was essentially free, I did end up trimming it to fit the crate and letting the cover be a little loose, it's a big hit as a crate mat and my crate averse older, bigger dog has even snuck in to the crate a few times to lay on it. I can't think of higher praise than that. Minus a star just for the price - I'm sure there's a reason, but dang I have a hard time justifying that kind of spend on a dog bed.",4

She is not a chewer so, I am not sure how it would hold up to that. Also, she is small dog and it supports her very well but seems soft enough. I am not sure how well it holds up to a larger dog, say over 30Lb over the years. Our large dog has an expensive (170 buck) true memory foam orthopedic bed. There is a definite difference between the two beds, but the little dog just does not need that much support. Really wonderful little bed for the price. A crate pad type bed enough ""cozy"" for our girl, so we did add a flimsy fluffy sided bed because she gets cold easily and her crate is so big. Second one August 2022on left pictured . I wanted another bed for the same small dog above but this product is not the same. Seems less nice and the size is smaller so it is not snug in kennel. also the plush I ordered is very cheap feeling- it has a minor seem rip already and I am sure it will rip when dog does the “bed digging” moves.",One

Her old bed was very plush and hard to get in and out of, but this one was easier for her to manage. She had some messes and it was much easier to clean too. The memory foam is comfortable—I curled up with her on it often toward the end. It gave her and me plenty of support in the last few weeks of her life. I held onto it for 2 years after she passed despite not having a pet. I’m glad I did that too. I recently adopted two cats, and today I found them both laying on it. As far as pet beds go, I wasn’t thinking at the time how important it would be to get a good one, or to get one for pets I didn’t have yet, but it still worked out that way. Worth it.",10

J. Lehman,3.0,"November 3, 2021","Very nice cover, just ok foam.","The good: The cover is very nicely made. By far the cover is the best part of the purchase so far (have not had it long enough to see how well it will hold up). I got the windowpane cover (black). The texture is kinda like a very fine burlap. The fabric seems very sturdy. The best part, the zipper goes around 2 sides so it is very easy to get the foam in and out. There is even a nice fabric lip that covers the zipper making it invisible. I also liked that the foam had a separate light fabric cover over it. The not so good: The quality of the foam is rather, meh. You can easily compress it all the way to the floor. A little firmness to the noncooling cream foam layer would have been nice. The foam never got quite to 3"" and, frankly, I would go for a bed that is 4-5"" if this is going to be your dogs main laying area. 3"" is a lot thinner than you think. I cut a piece of 2"" memory foam mattress pad and shoved it in on top of the ""cooling"" foam. The cover still zipped easily and it is much more like a cushion now. The blue foam layer does actually seem cool, although this did not matter to me as I put a pee pad and another layer of foam over it inside the cover as my puppy is still not 100% trustworthy. In summary, would I buy again? The cover, most definitely...if it were sold separately. I would not pay for the whole bed again. As a whole, I do not recommend.",

Saldana,4.0,"October 17, 2019",I think I would buy again.,"Purchased the large. First impression “it’s not bad”. The bed fluffed up relatively quickly to the (just shy of) 3”. The cover feels soft and cozy. I own a 6 year old Big Barker 7” memory foam mattress that my senior Beagle prefers to sleep on, but I had to commandeer the Barker for my Rhodesian mix while recovering from her recent surgery. I didn’t want to cough up the money for another Big Barker. Even the mini Barker price is a little steep for my liking at only a 1” memory foam difference compared to the BarkBox bed. This is a good solution. It’s also easier for my senior girl to get on/off of. I feel the large bed is better suited for a medium sized dog who likes to sprawl out. My Beagle is a little overweight, so the medium would not have been sufficient. On the other hand the large would not give my 74 lb Rhodesian enough room to sprawl out comfortably. The pea squeaky plush that came with the bed is a cute addition. I’m not sure about other reviewers complaints. Maybe each bed size comes with its own pea size? The pea I received is about tennis ball size, possibly a little larger. “Play Yard” sheets and waterproof covers make an excellent fit and added layer of protection. I purchased a large bed yesterday afternoon for $49.99 with a $10 off coupon making the bed $39.99. I think $39.99 is a decent price compared to the garbage beds I see being sold in the big box stores.",One

I am disappoint","This bed is amazing and fits my dog's crate perfectly. My pitbull has eaten and ripped to shreds every single bed we have out in his crate after several months but so far I havent seen him even try to chew this bed. Likely that is because it ai perfectly flat and there's no edge to chew on. He loves its cushy softness and will go in his crate to take a nap just because. I love that it has a removable cover to wash. Unfortunately, I washed the cover for the first time tonight and it came out of the dryer with two splits in the fabric. These are perfectly straight open lines in the fabric, obviously not from a dog's nail or teeth. Maybe I got a defective one? I've had the bed for 2 months and just washed it for the first time (gross I know...but I've hot two small kids so hey, world's okayest dog mom here). I'm disappointed in the holes because now I bet they will rip further from use. I'm not sure if I can return it but the product says it is 100% guaranteed so maybe customer service will see this and let me know if I can get a new cover.",

The cover is insanely easy to clean and no dog hair gets through to the mattress. It even holds up to the cat kneading. Both mattress' inflated all the way and were the correct dimensions. Just like any vacuum sealed foam pad leave it a few hours to inflate all the way. You also get a free squeaky ball with each bed. The second ones box was so damaged both ends were ripped opened but thats a shipping issue and the product was still fine when i opened it. Would highly recommend. UPDATE: after getting a shelter dog i ordered a 3rd bed in the extra large size just as nice as the other two, all of which are different versions. The first two are still as good as when i got them two years ago it looks like they updated the boxes to be more like one of those single piece shoe box type boxes and its A LOT more sturdy. The new dog funnyly enough will ONLY play with the free balls included with the mattresses and im super excited to see her play for the first time. I would recommend going up a size if your dog has a long back and sleeps sprawled out instead of a ball. 1000 percent recommend these beds!",

I was excited about a large, memory fiam dog bed with a washable cover. After letting it fluff up as recommended, I tried it out, and the bed is really comfortable and supportive. Loaded it up with the blanket and toys and waited for bedtime. Miss Pup curled up in the bed like she owned it and went right to sleep. Sadly, she did not stay that way. She woke up every few hours, shook her ears and rattled her tags. Her squashed old bed has bolster sides and she wanted it back, in spite of it having next to no remaining padding and the new bed being incredibly comfortable. After 2 nights of ear flapping, foot stamping, and tag rattling, we compromised. The squashed bolsters now top the lofted memory foam mattress, and Miss Pup snoozes like the princess she knows she is in an incredibly comfortable nest of fluff and support, covered with an appropriately applied blanket at all times. She'd tell you about it herself, but she refuses to get out of the bed. She did, however, give full marks to the squeaky pea-shaped toy that was included with the bed. Fun for fetching and tugging!",

This is literally one small critique of a product I adore (and will definitely buy for my boy again) but I feel like it's very important. We bought this product specifically because it was chew proof, but a few hours left unattended (we had gone to bed for the night) he had torn a hole and was scattering bits of foam all over the place because the cover for the bed was super thin and didn't seam sturdy enough to be ""chew-proof"", we just sighed and cleaned everything up and then covered the whole mattress with a blanket to discourage more chewing and to preserve our nearly $70 purchase.

It was completely dry and free of doggy smell. This is a WONDERFUL product and my doggies LOVE IT! If they could write a review, they would give two paws up!

Would recommend to tall dog lovers out there. Very supportive and might a memory foam mattress for you four-legged friend.",One

After normal use and washing according to the instructions, the zipper on the platform bed cover broke off. I will say the memory foam has held up well over time, but now I’m left with an expensive unusable bed. I would expect higher quality from Bark. Original review: 5/5 stars. We got this bed with the intention to use the bottom as a crate mat and will eventually use the bolster parts as our puppy grows older. The stripe cover will look great with our home decor (I hate the look of most dog beds), and the “cooling” top layer will hopefully be great for our fluffy bernedoodle. The memory foam arrives sealed and will expand over time. We left it out about 32 hours, and it expanded to the advertised size. We have a 36” Frisco crate with the divider in place. The large bed length and width are perfect! I was nervous the crate divider would press too much into the bed, but it doesn’t much at all. Our 9 week old puppy has been reliably not having any accidents in her crate, but I still like that the cover has a waterproof lining and is machine washable just in case. It isn’t the softest, but I didn’t expect it to be because of the waterproof feature. She plopped right on it and napped after I put it in there. Although she’s in the puppy biting phase, she hasn’t tried to bite this yet, so I can’t comment on its chew proof quality. Overall, we’re very pleased!

Size Bought: Large, with the pillow bumpers. Size of Dog: 48lbs and long; he is 11 years old now so at least he won't be getting longer. He is part Australian cattle dog and part dachshund (roughly corgi size) and he likes to stretch out to sleep. The medium would've probably worked if he curled up all the time, but the large fit his sleep style. The mattress took about 2 days to puff up; I got the flannel sheets that were sold seperately and they look pretty good. I did the assembly by myself, it was fairly easy and Rolfie took to the bed right away. He really loves to rest his head on the bumpers and the bed itself is easy to clean. Haven't had any water incidents, so not sure how it hold up there but so far it's been worth the cost! Looks great too. Also kudos for the extra fairytale crown and pea! The toy is a huge hit.",

When I saw this one came with removable bolsters, I was sold. Bark is a brand I trust and this bed didn’t disappoint. The bolsters really fill out the sides and they’re very cushy while remaining supportive. My shiba loves to peak over the edge of bolster beds and this one keeps his head propped up. The mattress part fits securely in place but allows some room to stash toys (which the dogs love to do). All photos taken were less than 10 minutes after I built the bed. Clearly the pillows haven’t fully expanded after being packed but they’re still big and supportive! For reference, I got a medium. My shiba (20lbs) doesn’t usually doesn’t ball up when he sleeps so it is perfect for him. My husky (50lbs) is a little too large for it, which I expected.",

Their passion for dogs has always shown through the toys and the same can be said for this dog bed! If you let the foam fluff out for the recommended 48 hrs, it's pretty thick and soft! It's easy to wash because you can just pull out the actual pad part that they lay on and not have to wash the sides/structure of the bed. The fabric is pretty good too because the fur doesn't really stick to it and is easy to wipe off. She's an 8lb pomeranian and we got her the medium size.

Original Review: My dogs were uninterested in this bed until I put it in their crate. Unfortunately, though it seems to have a coating inside the cover that would keep liquid from soaking through, it did not keep urine out of the foam. My dog was recently diagnosed with heart failure and the meds she has to be on causes her to drink a lot more than usual. This caused her to have an accident in the crate, and since the cover did not protect the foam, now I'm stuck trying to figure out how to get urine out of memory foam. 😒",

The old one had been washed one too many times to really get clean. So I bought this one. It looks nice and it’s very cushy, so I imagine it’s very comfy for my dog. But I do have an issue with this crate pad: Barkbox put the tag on the OUTSIDE of the cover! Seriously? They are a company that sells items specifically for dogs and the tags are on the outside of the cover. Tags made of Tyvek - a non-digestible, non-dissolving material - on the OUTSIDE of a crate pad. For dogs. Who will put anything in their mouth they think is tasty, fun or interesting. And EAT IT. Really? Dogs are like freakin’ toddlers - EVERYTHING goes in the mouth! Barkbox should know this (being, after all, a company dedicated to dogs). Because I think the crate pad will be very nice for my dog to sleep on I decided to keep it. I tried to carefully cut the tags off so I didn't cut through the seam (I sew so I'm really good with scissors) but no such luck, the seam split. It was a small enough split that I was able to fix it with a few stitches with a needle and thread (if it needed the sewing machine it was going back to Amazon). I shouldn't have to do this, but there is no way I'm leaving those Tyvek tags on the outside. If a dog were to tear them off and eat them (like my little guy likely would) it could possibly require surgical removal since Tyvek won’t breakdown (remember it was originally designed as a moisture barrier for houses...). Yes, the tags are important, but not as important as them NOT being on the outside of the cover. Think a little better about your design, Barkbox.",

NONE of the inner foam was touched. Not a single inkling that disaster had struck and only a small layer of fabric shielded it from imminent death.

It fluffed up pretty quickly, though it does state it could take 24-48 hours to fully expand. Also, the design seems close to dog-proof. No easily accessible zippers, and all of the covers are removable/washable. We bought the large size, in anticipation of puppy-growth.

Just got this in the mail this afternoon, and my first impression is WOW it's sturdy. A little cumbersome to put together (having each side be separate pieces that all have to be finagled into one zippered pouch was a little time consuming), but I think it will be great for my bigger senior dog. Going to have to wait 1-3 days for the foam bottom bed to fully inflate, but as of right now I only have positive first impressions.",

She has always had a pretty flat bed with blankets so this is a real upgrade. It was hard to get the bolsters zipped in by myself but with some help from my 7 year old, we were able to stuff them in. Some advice for assembly would be to stuff more of the bolster into the sleeve at the beginning so you don't end up with an empty pocket of space in the crack of the bed and to much bolster for the space you have. I haven't had to take it apart to clean it yet but the material is east to spot clean. I keep it covered with a blanket most of the time anyway. I would buy this bed again.",

Once I informed the cats it was not their new bed I had it on the floor for Pagani who lost her bed 2 weeks ago to her brother deciding it was a good place to throw up. Once I called her in from her kennel to try it (carrying her new toy) she laid right down and has been there for an hour snoring. She loves bolstered beds to snuggle into and curl up with but also loves to stretch out at times. She’s a good sized dog at 70+ pounds and very muscular. She’s already had both knees repaired for tendon tears so she drastically prefers a soft supportive cushion to be on. This bed provides her the bolster cuddles as well as the support for her joints and the head propping to survey me without expending to much energy. We will see how it wears but I’m hopeful.,

Our border collie, Solomon, usually shreds and de-stuffs plush dog toys in a matter of minutes. Not an exaggeration. Although it's only been a few days, this sloth has by far outlasted every other plush squeaky toy we've tried. When looking at the BarkBox options, I decided to give the sloth a try for a few strategic reasons: 1) Unlike some of the other toys, there aren't a lot of small, thin limbs or parts that can easily be tugged and chewed on. 2) Solomon loves to tear into the fabric. This sloth has fur instead. So when Solomon tries to pull or tug the fur, MOST of it just goes through his teeth. I have been finding small tufts of sloth fur here and there, but 99% of the fur is still on the sloth. I'd also like to mention that while this IS a squeaky toy, it's not a super annoying squeaky toy. It does take a little force for it to make a noise, so when Solomon is gently gnawing on the sloth or playing with it, it's generally quiet. When he gives it a good bite, then it's a solid, squeak - not super high pitched. If your dog generally destroys plushy dog toys, but you still want to get that ""awwww, so cute"" moment that you can't quite get with a dog and his tennis ball, then definitely consider the BarkBox sloth! TIP: Make sure you cut the fabric tag off the toy. Tags seem to be a prime chew target and weak spot for plush toys. UPDATE: Day 5 - Poor Gordon has lost a limb. His right arm has been gnawed off. His remaining limbs are still attached and intact. Final Update: Gordon was totally de-stuffed by Day 7. The squeaker lasted about 3 days before hitting trash status. Solomon still gnaws on Gordon's limp, destuffed body. So technically, he still ""plays"" with this toy, but really the lifespan was around 10 days. Still not bad for a cloth, stuffed toy vs. a moderately aggressive chewer.",

Sheng,3.0,"April 28, 2020",Too hard and awkwardly shaped for an older Labrador,"This dog bed has really sleek and modern design. It is well made with quality material. I REALLY wanted to like it. HOWEVER, after more than a month of trying, it is just not working for my 75-lb 13-yo arthritic Labrador. I bought a size large bed. The listed dimensions are 35x22. But those are the OUTSIDE dimensions. The actual dimensions inside the bolsters are more like 27x15. It is a very oddly long and narrow shape. If you have a Corgi or a very large Dachshund, it would probably work fine. But for a dog with real legs like a Lab (nothing against Corgis and Dachshunds ;) ), it’s just really uncomfortable. My dog can’t comfortably lie on his side and stretch his legs out at all. The bed covers are made of a very stiff canvas material that does not stretch very much at all. That makes the bed hold its shape extremely well, but also gives the foam nowhere to expand sideways when a dog sleeps in it and tries to squish it down. Again, I really liked the design and quality of this bed and really wish I can say this is a great bed. But after a month’s trying, it just isn’t. My dog refuses to use it at all. :(",

I don’t look forward to washing this thing and taking it apart again but I think it’s worth it. Maybe it’ll get easier with practice.

I love that it's easy to clean, water resistant, and transformable. I can take the bottom bed portion out and put it in his crate or take it along in the car. The supportive foam bed portion filled up almost completely in just an hour and was easy to zip into its washable cover. The nicely filled bolsters were a little difficult to put together. It was definitely easier to do with two people. One squeezing some air out and lining up the zippers while the other zipped it up.

It would be great for two regular sized cats, or dogs, or 1 large dog. My biggest issue is because the foam tubes, that are in the inside of the frame are split in 2, the frame tends to be a little v-shaped on the longer sides rather than in a straight perpendicular line to the smaller sides. I have the bed on a cabinet and, once in awhile, one of the cats will be in that V and the bed will tip over onto the floor! I've started rotating it around, every few days, and that does help.",

My 81# eurohound absolutely loves this thing- she accidently tinkled on it once because she was so excited to see the dog trainer- but I pulled the cover off and washed it right up. We put it up when we're not home because our cat is a jerk and likes to pee on the dog's bed out of spite, so as soon as the dog gets up and out of her crate in the morning, she pulls it down to lay on. By far the best investment- the cover is nice and heavy- water/ tinkle proof, and it's not breaking down like her KONG bed did. The only reason I gave it 4/5 for ease of assembly was because the bolsters are a bit tricky to get stuffed in correctly- some people may need a helper.",

The bed is folded for shipping and that leaves a bulge in the middle of the bed. It would be better if the bed is not folded for shipping.

The memory foam must be really comfortable for them, and I think they feel warm and snug in our chilly house. The raised edge protects from drafts down on the floor. We put it in a corner with low windows so the dog can keep watch in comfort. Get this bed if you want to get them to stop sleeping on your couch, as they find it much more comfortable. I grant you an Orvis dog bed looks a lot nicer (because of less blah fabrics), but costs about twice as much.

For years he has been hooked on the Outward Hound Invincibles Snakes, but once I pulled this out of the box along with a new snake toy he went crazy over the sloth. Poor snake toy has been mostly ignored since then! The sloth toy isn’t super durable (the squeaker was torn out and killed in 30 minutes, which I expected) but he has continued playing with it for weeks regardless! He carries it around the house and even sleeps with it. I think the fur texture is unique enough that it provides lasting interest and takes a while to fully destroy because of the fact that the fur sort of shreds. Doggo is entertained by shredding the long fur instead of tearing the fabric apart, which is what he does with other stuffies. It’s definitely one of the best stuffed animal toys we’ve bought for him. We will definitely be repurchasing in the future. Edit: I’m not sure but I think they improved the squeaker! I finally had to reorder since there was nothing but a small fabric scrap remaining of the original sloth, and this one had a pretty large squeaker inside. As per usual, Greyson tore it open to remove the squeaker but he’s been playing with it for a couple hours now and it’s *still* squeaking (extremely loudly, I might add lol). It’s large enough that I’m not worried about him swallowing it and we’ve been playing fetch with it too. I sewed up mister sloth after Greyson disemboweled it and I think he will last quite a while now that his squeaker is gone. Grey is very fond of his second sloth and was practically vibrating with excitement when I opened the Amazon package and took off the tag. Very good toy!",8

Inside the box, and I'm not entirely familiar with how this company handles monthly subscriptions, but there were two bags of treats, two toys and a protein bar; all of which was colored in this immensely tacky-looking (I'm guessing 80's themed?) light pinks and blues. Just looking at them I was immediately disappointed. I would share photos of the brochure and other paper items that came with it but they found their way to the garbage pretty quickly. Everything just looked like it was cheaply designed and made. Very tacky. The treats? - Had a cheap smell to them if that makes sense. The toys? - My 10 month old golden retriever has dozens of toys, too many in fact and she has never damaged a single one - she's ripped holes in both toys and its been 3 days.

Problem with stuffed animals is that the dogs ice those in an almost literal blink of an eye. They go right to the seams and seconds later the thing is disemboweled, and later the dog is passing stuffing. However, at least the dog enjoys it as a stimulating toy. Upgrade to Super Chewer thinking toys that last longer, but instead they send chunks of hard plastic that the dogs are utterly not interested in. Literally, they are equally stimulated by a rock we pass on our walks, because that rock is not interesting at all, except to maybe relieve upon. These are the only BB toys that are worth anything. They get the pleasure of tearing it apart, and then there is another longer lasting toy inside, an actual toy, a ball, which they love. No stuffing cleanup, and no stubbing my toes on chunks of hard plastic. BB I know you guys sure don't read the reviews of your toys on your own website, I hope you do here. Give me a monthly box of 2-3 of these and I will come back, but this is literally the only toy style you guys make that is worth it. I would rather have a subscription, and cut out the middleman (sorry Amazon), but until you guys can offer that I will buy these here.",3

The base actually lasted the longest at nearly two weeks before he ripped through it. We would buy the round base as a toy on its own, BARK! The whole round base is one giant rubber squeaker, and our dog would go wild for it. We rolled it across the hall, thew it like a frisbee, and he loved it.

They had a grinch squeaky toy that Jake *loved*. Big spiky ball in the head with a good squeaker in it made the head tough for him to catch when tossing it around, but he could bite the smaller body just fine. The grinch was starting to tear along the seam in the back of the head, but Jake loved that toy and didn't go all destructi-pup on it like he normally does with toys. Until one night, when Maia was jealous of Jake getting attention or had too much pent up energy or something. Next thing I knew, the tiny bit of stuffing from the head was on the floor, the body discarded, and Maia was sitting there victorious, with the spiky ball with bits of stuffing in her mouth. I wanted to replace the grinch toy, since Jake loved it so much. While these toys aren't another baby grinch, they do have the same squeaker in them. I tried Monsieur Acorn first, but he's too big for Jake's mouth to really play with it. Then, I thought I'd go with Penny the Pineapple. The stem would be something he could get his teeth around easily enough, but the body is the same problem as with Monsieur Acorn. Barkbox's toys are made so there's a toy within a toy, so when the dog destroys the outer toy, there's a fabric shell around the squeaker ball that has a more distressed face on it, then you have the squeaker ball instead of just the tiny squeakers that, if a dog tears them out, you have to trash them. Well, that Penny the Pineapple was a big hit. So much so that even Zeus likes it! His favorite toys are footballs/balls, and the body has that shape, so he went for it. Was bringing me the toy to throw for him and everything, when he usually just ignores most toys in the house. Maia saw him having fun and wanted the toy. She started up her shrieky barking to try to get him to drop it. He wouldn't. Soooo, she got her teeth around the pineapple stem and started a (very brief) tug of war with Zeus. Zeus has some major jaw strength, and if he wants to keep something, he will not lose a game of tug. Usually the toy goes before Zeus gives up (as plenty of torn, rubbery frisbees can attest to.) Stem separated from pineapple body, and now there's a small bundle of fabric leaves on the floor with the rest of the toy being taken into the kitchen somewhere out of my sight. Penny the Pineapple has been de-stemmed. And has a huge hole in her head. Monsieur Acorn just lays abandoned on the floor, fully intact. I might be ordering a Gordon the Giant Sloth toy soon for Jake.",One

I have ordered 2 more.","My 5-month-old male goldendoodle loves this sloth. He is very hard on toys. Mr sloth has survived one month now and this is a record. Mr sloth's hair like design run through the dog's teeth when he attempts to pull the hair out. This makes for much longer entertainment as he cannot tear Mr sloth apart. My puppy is very hard on toys, however I have ordered two more of these so that reincarnation can occur when he destroys the first one. The one downside of this product is when the dog manages to get a mouthful of hair, he eats it. However for a dog who suffers from constipation, this could be a benefit, as his bowel movements are very regular. Update: Senõr Sloth has his first hole. He has lasted x3months and I couldn't be happier.",

Don't tell anyone, because my apartment complex is convinced that she's a dog or something. (Can you imagine the pet fees for a T-Rex? ASTRONOMICAL.) She has a very, VERY strong urge to kill soft, fuzzy, squeaky things. Squeakers last maybe a few days. Lamb Chop? We don't talk about Lamb Chop. (Rip buddy - we only knew you for 12 hours before she disemboweled you. I never found your squeaker.) She especially likes taking her toys by the throat and thrashing them until they're ""ded"". (Not d-e-a-d dead, but d-e-d dead.) That's her signature move. Enter the parrot. Which, okay, he's super cute. He's a little pirate parrot with a pirate hat! He has a name! (I can't remember what it is because I had to rip off the tags before the t-rex ripped off my hands trying to get at it, but still, he had a name!) She freaking loves this thing. She's very confused because she can't get her little dinosaur jaws around its neck, which makes her want to kill it harder. She can't thrash it around because it's got some serious weight to it, which is great. The wings also make that crinkly sound that she goes NUTS over, so she chows down on the wings and tail like they're a bag of chips she can't open. Love love LOVE this thing!",66

Both of those products have last months are still going strong overall. I had expected similar lifetime for this 2 in 1 toy that came with 2 balls and a little backpack. Bailey (17 week old lab puppy) absolutely loved the balls. We played with just one of the balls and put the other away for later. within 3 hours the ball had split by more the 50% of the diameter and would no longer make the squeak he absolutely loved. This is the first Bark product I've had to return and I'm a little hesitant to keep going with their products if this is the quality that's to be expected. TL;DR - Be careful with this one, even light play and a very young puppy managed to somehow split this rubber almost in half within 3 hours of indoor play.",2

So far it’s going very well. She is happy making dents in the tail and I am happily surprised it is lightly scented like toothpaste. It’s surprisingly heavy. And it’s cute.

The covers lasted some time for my first puppy two years ago, and now they are just corpses to be chewed on and thrown around by the second day. Since there is no fluff, I let them shred and play with the material until the pieces get too small which is a week or two playing chase and tug o' war. The BALLS, these things are indestructible!! I have a pup who likes to shred rubber toys, and she has never gotten a spike off one of these. I have three or four laying around which is great! They bring them to me for fetch or carry them around and gnaw on them to relax. One or two still squeak, but that has no bearing on their fun. I'm absolutely certain the first day or two spines spines ingested with no ill effects. The flower does come off first and ends up being a subject of much ownership debate between them.

He'll usually lay on the couch and chew on it, so if it falls on the floor I have to pick it up and give it back to him because he has a hard time holding it in his mouth due to the weight. Maybe that will improve with time, since he's only 6 months old. He's about 50 lbs right now, so I would classify him as a medium dog at the moment. If you have a smaller dog, it's most definitely going to be too heavy, so just be aware of that. Otherwise, it's a great toy and my dog enjoys it.",3

Just a heads up... you’re not going to like stepping on it in the middle of the night. It’s like stepping on a Lego! We have an 8 month old Bernedoodle that LOVES to chew and destroy. We have completely given up on any fabric or plus toys that claim and swear they are durable for the most intense chewers. Well... they didn't work for Molly! However, this iguana has been incredible durable. I was a little hesitant after reading a few reviews but pulled the trigger anyways. She has been chewing it for over two months now and its' head nor tail has popped off. Our only concern is for our hard wood floors and tile. This toy is pretty heavy and when it drops... it drops with a thud! Other than that... it's seriously a durable, great toy! Molly takes hers everywhere and gets quite frustrated when we don't let her take it outside. Your dog will love it!",

She’s had it about 5 minutes and has ripped all of the spikes off of the cactus, taken it outside, and christened it with a dirt bath... 😂 it seems to be very sturdy on the inside. The double layers of fabric will be good for her, as her favorite pass times are skinning her tennIs balls and de-fluffing her stuffed toys. I’ll update this after she destroys it to let you know how long it lasted. Update::: Flora Jo had pulled the first skin off of this toy in under 3 hours. The second skin was saved because she bounced it into the mop bucket and I put in in the wash to make sure she wasn’t eating Odo-ban. After the wash and squishing out all of the water and letting it dry overnight , she had the second layer off within another couple hours... but you have to realize that this pup is in the league of the destucticons..... She loves the football that is in the middle, and is currently trying to chew the spikes off of it. Definitely worth the $10. So, we got Ms Flo Jo the pineapple toy as well, it took about 10 days for her to go into destruct-o mode on this one. Not sure if it was the crunchy leaves that put her off, but we’re 2 weeks in and she only has the first layer off. She adores the spiky football, she’s in the routine of taking it into her bed and rolling around in it... self massage? 😂 Great toy, definitely worth the money, will get more of these for the dingo of destruction!!!",

After I gave the new toy to my dog, she played with it for about 60 seconds and the squeaker already broke; she barely played with it at all. Re: the first toy, the squeaker held up for a relatively long time, but eventually started to work some times, and not work most other times. She has just recently accomplished tearing open the first toy. There is now a second one inside and we still play with it, even though the squeaker is going. The pineapple's squeaker does not come back and go away, it is just simply gone and does not work, and you can hear the air going in/out of the toy when it is squeezed, although it still has squeeze pressure, so she can at least chomp on it. Oh well, I guess they must have some sort of issue in manufacturing where the toys aren't 100% consistent. It is something to keep in mind when buying this toy. I would recommend if you feel lucky enough to get one that works. ORIGINAL REVIEW: I was looking for a squeaky toy that is durable, and this fits the bill. There are only a couple minor problems: the cactus 'spines' will be torn off very easily, so consider removing them yourself so your dog doesn't eat them or leave them scattered on the floor. The spines feel like tiny foam pieces. Also, you should probably remove the tag, too. It's a little hard to remove (to get close to the toy without cutting it open), so if you don't remove it completely, if your dog is like mine, they will chew/rip at the tag stub. Other than that, this toy has been great, and it is my dog's new favorite toy. She has yet to rip open this toy, and I don't see any signs of that happening anytime soon. I'm a little sensitive to loud noises, and I'm happy to say that the squeak on this toy is not too loud for me, and she seems to still have a lot of fun with it. I'm going to buy another version of this toy from this brand again, and I highly recommend it for aggressive chewers.",One

I got it for our Yorkie puppy who loves to chew and shred. We've had this item for just under three weeks. My husband joked and said it ""wouldn't last a day"". I think it took about 2 days for him to pull off the flower (this wasn't a surprise to me, I figured it would be the first thing he would tear off). I also read other reviews and decided to cut off the cactus spikes before letting our dog have the toy. I think they were made of a foam-like material, and they wouldn't have lasted long. Overall, I'm impressed with the durability of this toy. Our Yorkie hasn't gotten to the second layer completely yet, but he has been able to tear off one of Consuela's eyes (the one that's open), but he's not yet figured out how to tear the rest of the top layer off. He also hasn't been able to rip off an arm (which I honestly figured would be 2nd to go after the flower, since he loves tugging on toys). Not sure about how it would do with big dogs, but for our little 5 lb tornado, it's held up longer than I thought it would. If he ever gets to the final layer, I'll definitely buy another one of these toys.",

Because of this, when my puppy chews on the toy, he normally does so on the head because it’s most convenient for him to reach. But, because that part and the tail are made out of the cheap plastic material, it’s been breaking up into small pieces, and I’ve been worrying that my pup is swallowing these pieces.

We've had it a week now and even with five dogs, it's still got most of its fleece cover intact - and not for lack of trying, because between my pittie and my American Bulldog, nothing really lasts long. They'd just rather squish the ball than shred the cloth (for now!) I do actively supervise all of my dogs with any toys that have fabric, and this one is no different. The last photo shows how stringy the material is when shredded - the stringy material is like heavy duty thread, and got caught between my pittie's teeth (which happens with any cloth toy she gets; that's why I watch her!)

The clasps are well made, the sewing is tight, and the material is heavy duty. I have two complaints about this product though. First, I live in Nebraska where we get hot and humid summers. The straps on this harness are heavy rubber and my black haired dog gets overheated very quickly in warmer temps. These straps would only compound her problem because they don't breathe and I'm afraid she would develop a rash (which is what neoprene collars have done to her) or it would cause her to overheat more quickly. Also, I don't like that there isn't a handle on the top of the harness. Sometimes I just need to grab her to keep her from moving, maybe when we're seated or just to keep her close. Not having one means I have to fumble with the leash to restrain her. So overall quality is quite good, it's just not the perfect harness for my climate and my preferences.",7

The harness is truly adjustable and very easy to do so. My 40 lb lab mix is always too small for large and too big for medium, so the range that the medium is able to go was great for him. I love that there's two places to connect the leash, and this completely solves the problem of him choking himself out with just a collar from getting too excited. Doesn't irritate his sensitive skin, tons of shoulder space for mobility. Super durable, and the rubber makes it easy to clean. The padded leash handle is sooo comfortable to grip, and so sturdy too.

Backs around 12 inches. They fit into a small. They can trip on the front if they try to jump off of things like the couch. The front velcro is huge. This helps to get them dry after their bathes. They don’t mind wearing them. The material is not that soft. It’s the same material as the rags you can buy to wash your car. I personally don’t like the material. I would rather feel a terrycloth fabric. The dogs are adorable in them and because they are told how cute they are they prance around in them. So all is well. My friends have bought them for their dogs because of how cute mine are in them 💖,7

We found these harnesses didn’t not stop the pulling. As there is no redirection of the dogs head, so it is actually easier for them to pull. A gentle lead / bridle setup is better if you want to control the dogs attention and not have them pull you over. This might be a good way to control a small/tiny dog as you can just lift them up but for anything bigger it is the same design used by dog mushers for racing because it makes the dog want to pull. If you do want your dog to pull you,,, this is great. We have used this with skateboards and bikes and the dogs can run for miles without getting too tired.

Noack,5.0,"October 2, 2021",Great option for quality:price,"I purchased this harness for my 4 year old hound mix. She is around 40lbs and very long, I ordered a medium and am very pleased with the way it fits. I've had a hard time finding a harness that works for her because of her proportions (long dog, thick chest, skinny neck with lots of loose skin), her first two harnesses were a longer design because I thought that would make sense, but they were tight around her middle and then really loose around her neck, so less effective for deterring pulling because they would just twist around. I was fed up paying $60+ for harnesses that are ineffective and fall apart (her last one was a RUFFWEAR and I was really annoyed when I realized I'd paid a lot of money for basically just mesh sewn around a piece of foam). We've only gone on one walk with this one but so far I'm pleased. It fits her better than anything else, it's easy to adjust and put on, and it looks cute. She is not a huge puller, but when she catches a scent she REALLY pulls, and this harness seems to reduce the impact of her pulling on my joints, which is really what I'm looking for. I'm a little skeptical about the rubber straps, I'm worried they might break, and it seems like they might rub around her shoulders. If I have to loosen it to keep it from rubbing it kind of negates the good fit. So, we'll see, but so far I'm very happy with it. At this price it's pretty low stakes/high reward.",
