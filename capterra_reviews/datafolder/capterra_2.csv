Bob T.,Online Radio Expert/Host; Podcast Host; Ordained Minister/Award Winning Author/Prof. Public Speaker,"Non-Profit Organization Management, Self-employed",2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,Capterra,10/09/2019,100 percent satisfied. I have been approached with offers to switch. I turn every single one of them down. QuickBooks has proven to be to be the absolute best software for me to use in this area.,"I love QuickBooks for Non-Profits!  I have used this software exclusively for the past 10 years with no problems at all. 

I have received numerous compliments from Board Members of the accuracy and detail I provide when it comes to our financial reports. I have been told I provide the best reports they have seen (many are members of other non-profit boards). It is all accomplished with just a few clicks and the reports printed out!","It does take a bit of getting used to. Especially when you are first setting up the system. Once it is set up, it runs along fine.

One thing to make sure of is the category of the items you are entering. Otherwise, your reports will contain mis-categorized information. Be sure to check over your reports for accuracy in that area.  If identified, it is a simple fix - but you must check it over."
Leah D.,Office Administrator,"Law Practice, 1-10 employees",1-2 years,5,5,5,5,5,10,Capterra,08/06/2023,It has been an overall positive experience.  Our old program was clunky and really was not designed like move modern programs.  Quickbooks Online Advanced is truly a great product.,I like that everything is easy to use and intuitive.  We swapped from another program and were able to jump right in and start working immediately with little to no training.,The only issue that I have with Quickbooks Online Advanced has to do with the integration with Clio.  The issue happens when you write one check to a vendor for multiple client matters.  It ports them over to Clio as one entry.  Other than that everything works perfectly.

Virginia M.,Owner,"Financial Services, Self-employed",2+ years,5,5,3,5,5,10,Capterra,22/05/2023,,I like the simplicity and the ease of use for all levels of my customers skills,The customer service is not very good for higher end processing questions
Wes S.,Vice President,"Retail, 11-50 employees",1-2 years,3,1,,3,5,6,Capterra,14/09/2020,"We have used Enterprise for years and we had to make a change because our inventory was getting out of control. Sadly, Enterprise is missing about 5 things to make their manufacturing perfect and it just doesn't look like that is ever going to happen. Accordingly, we had to try and find an MRP software and the only way it would work well was moving to QBO. This was like making a choice to either get punched in the gut or punched in the throat. Either inventory was workable or accounting was workable.",It integrates with our current ECommerce cart and a few other programs (e.g. Zapier).,"They have radically tried to over-simplify the product. For instance, the Vendor tab being under Expenses. As every accountant knows, Vendors aren't solely about Expenses. This is just one example of how, in trying to make this product more intuitive, they have thwarted anyone with accounting experience in using it.

There are so many things you cannot delete. Too many to try and list here."
Paula L.,Asst. Manager Finance,"Hospitality, 51-200 employees",6-12 months,5,4,4,4,5,9,Capterra,07/06/2023,"in overall, a very positive outlook. I believe that it is necessary, but it would be wonderful to have the option of including additional modules without corresponding 100% rise in cost.","The structure of the site is excellent. All of the features have clear labels. In comparison to the desktop version, it has a simpler design. There are still some tweaks that could be performed to make it incredibly easy to use when compared to other applications.","There is nothing specific to mention, other than the fact that it appears to be somewhat technical. Someone with less experience in accounting might want additional time to comprehend how it all works."
Haridas K.,Chief Accountant,"Accounting, 11-50 employees",2+ years,4,4,4,4,4,9,Capterra,23/06/2023,"QuickBooks Online Advanced is a powerful solution designed for medium to large businesses, addressing scalability with robust features, enhanced reporting, and customizable user access.

CA Krishan K.,Manager,"Accounting, 1-10 employees",2+ years,5,5,4,5,4,10,Capterra,02/06/2023,Great,"Data entry can be done using the mobile app. You can login on your laptop once a month to reconcile all the transactions. During the month, just a mobile ap is enough to capture the transactions.","It does not provide VAT/Sales tax report in the format required by Feder Tax Authority, UAE. Quickbooks is working on it but it has been five years now."
Molly C.,Senior Financial Manager,"Information Technology and Services, 51-200 employees",1-2 years,5,5,4,4,5,10,Capterra,11/12/2019,"The cost for this product is amazing.  We have saved $100,000 yr since switching from NetSuite. My team and I honestly prefer QuickBooks for everyday bookkeeping and business operations. For our company the switch was a no-brainer.",This software is so easy to use and makes training a breeze.  A ton of the functionality makes everything more efficient and intuitive.  The reporting is awesome and easy to create your own custom reports.,You cannot have multiple tabs open and you cannot easily create consolidated financials to include multiple instances.
Harmony F.,Business Office Manager,"Wholesale, 11-50 employees",6-12 months,4,3,,2,5,7,Capterra,11/12/2019,"Our overall experience with QBO Advanced has been pretty good. I think with the development and implementation of more features or customization of different ""modules"" to be customer specific it would serve us perfectly. And hey, the price is WONDERFUL!  ",What I like most about using QBO Advanced is how user friendly and simplistic it is to use. We transitioned our entire financial management system and for the most part it was relatively smooth. ,"There were many obstacles to overcome in the transition to QBO Advanced. It mainly involve how to find work around solutions for areas not offered in QBO Advanced such as specifically detailed inventory management and also fixed assets. The inventory process in QBO is clunky and too simplistic for our company, BUT since QBO is so easy to use we have customized processes to make it work for us. "
Kevin Z.,Director Of Operations,"Hospitality, 1-10 employees",2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,Capterra,11/12/2019,I am currently learning how to better integrate my time keeping services with quick books and I am overall happy with the transisiton,"This Software is absolutely essential to my day to day operations.
From the ease of use in payroll services, tracking inventory, combining all purchase and financing accounts and creating invoices for all of my customers I could not be happier with Quickbooks.
What I really love is that software is always adapting and improving to help with more and more essential tasks, and if I don't know how something works there is always a Webinar/Customer service agent/video to give myself and my employees the tools they need to meet any accounting challenge.","The only two issues I have had is with compatibility with the payroll time clock services I would like to use, and this is more personal preference than anything else. I would like to see more options for bio metric time-clocking services than is currently available. the second is the saving of last used dates in the software meaning you have to be vigilant when making invoices or printing checks (I have lost a ton of checks this way)"
Curran H.,Admin Assistant,"Public Policy, 11-50 employees",6-12 months,4,3,5,5,5,10,Capterra,21/08/2019,"Overall I find it very helpful. It is easy to enter and find bills. It had a steep learning curve, but once overcome, it is extremely helpful software.","The ability to find any transaction, bill very fast. There are reports that can be deeply customized, bills can be searched easily, and it is easy to switch between companies.","It has too many features! It has a million options, and options within options. If you are inexperienced with the software, it can be hard to find what you are looking for. Once you do find things it becomes quite simple."
Karen S.,Accountant/Owner,"Accounting, 1-10 employees",2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,Capterra,23/02/2021,I have been using Quickbooks Non-Profit for years and all entries and creation of programs for a non-profit provides a visual presentation that provides Board Members and Financial Auditors the clarity and simplifies where the non-profit stands. ,"Due to the complexities of non-profit financials. Quickbooks alleviates much of the work and assists with proper allocations of Donor Contribution, Grants and Foundation monies. Classifying expenses is also tricky without the easy to use features Quickbooks non-profit software provides. ",I cannot think of any downfalls. I have used other non-profit accounting softwares and Quickbooks is by the far the best.
Tara S.,Controller,"Construction, 11-50 employees",6-12 months,5,5,3,4,4,10,Capterra,11/12/2019,"On a day to day bases, it is easy to use and easy to see a quick snapshot of where our company stands. Customers can view and pay their invoices online and money is deposited quickly. It has helped increase our cashflow.",The software was fairly easy to set up and is very easy to use. Very forgiving. Errors can be corrected easily. (with the exceptions noted below) ,"The recurring transaction feature does not always work as expected.
Accounts or products that are created in error can only be made inactive, not deleted.  We now have a lot of extras since the accountant that helped us import our Sage data imported everything twice. We have 2 of all our products and accounts. "
Ross H.,Office Manager,"Consumer Services, 11-50 employees",2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,Capterra,18/10/2022,"Overall my experience has been good, a few times either myself or another user has made a mistake but with the help of online and phone support we got the issue fixed in a timely manner.","Overall the software is easy to use and robust New features have a learning curve as with most things, the online help with this is good.",The price can be daunting for smaller businesses or even individuals
Katherine M.,Office Manager,"Wine and Spirits, 11-50 employees",2+ years,4,4,3,4,4,6,Capterra,09/11/2022,"Overall my experience has been mostly positive. There was a major issue earlier this year where the one account we used was not allowing me to pay for the service. It said my accountant had billing rights, but he wasn't getting bills either. We would randomly and for days at a time not be able to access this one account at all. I would call and call and each representative that I talked to had different ""solutions"" but none of them worked. One even told me that our entire data was gone because we didn't pay the bill and we would have to start a new account. It was pretty ludicrous. It literally took about five months to get it resolved when finally, the last of about 13 reps that I talked to did what really needed to get done to fix it. Just seems like they're not on the same page as far as knowledge of this software. ","For the most part, this software is user friendly. It is organized and efficient and keeping my accounting and bookkeeping for the company on track. ","There are several things this software does (or doesn't do) that make it a bit cumbersome. For example, there are certain accounts you cannot load into vendor details because it's not a ""cost"". But we have ""cost of sales"" and that is one of our biggest used account but I cannot load it into vendor cards just because it's not a cost account. I don't like the way the reconciliation works. I don't use the automatic feature because it makes it harder than it's worth when I have to go out of the menu altogether for it to register that something that automatically ""reconciled"" is to be accounting for. "
Veronica N.,Consultant Manager,"Food & Beverages, 11-50 employees",2+ years,4,3,4,5,3,10,Capterra,28/07/2021,"Overall my experience has been good with Quickbooks online advanced. The product has all the features needed to run a business, get the reporting and also connecting with useful apps developed by different partners. Especially during this unprecedented times when online presence is fundamental QBO Advances provides access to not the only an accounting platform but also easy integration to other partners like Third party delivery, PoS, e-commerce, ACH Payments, etc.",The software is designed to simplify the journey by increasing the quality of the data input during the booking of the transactions and eliminating  common mistakes during the process of bookkeeping. I like how the bank feed makes easier every bank reconciliation and provides a lot of information directly from the bank statement. ,"I do not like that the migration from desktop to online is not easy and the online version has some missing features compared with the desktop version. I also do not like the Inventory module does not have all the information for food products, like expiration date or lot control "
Tammy P.,Staff Accountant,"Computer Software, 51-200 employees",2+ years,5,4,5,5,5,10,Capterra,11/12/2019,,"QBO Advanced includes the analytics through dashboards and Fathom.  These are powerful tools and very useful for management.  The Enhanced Custom Fields are valuable for our company as we are able to capture information that can be kept in QBO with the client instead of having several spreadsheet to keep this information.  The Customize Access By Role is helpful for us because we are able to then develop UI from our software into QBO allowing our developer to have access to QBO but not have access to the entire company file.  Feedback is very vital for us the user.  As we find something that could make our jobs easier, or a way of getting information out you can always enter the feedback in for Intuit's development team to review.  I have experienced that some feedback has been addressed, which adds value for us because we know that the software is becoming a tool that will do all that we need it to do.","We lost a couple reports when we converted over from desktop, but Intuit is constantly working on enhancing the software."
Joy K.,Executive Director,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 1-10 employees",2+ years,4,4,3,5,5,8,Capterra,31/05/2022,"I am very satisfied with QBO overall, especially since we also use Quickbooks payroll. 
Entering receipts and information is very easy and reporting is very intuitive. 

I do with there was a better way to enter multiple receipts from a payment processor site(Square/Stripe), versus the batch deposits as the systems integrate now. ","It is easy to enter information into Quickbooks and find it later. 
Reports are great! I can always find the infromation I need in a ready report, and love that I can click within a report to access more detailed infromation. 
","As a non-profit, it can get a little complicated when tracking restricted revenues and their related expenses. 
Year end reporting for fulfilling the 990 is not easy when working around the chart of accounts as it us set up in QBO - some account categories don't match up with the way nonprofits track them. "
Courtney Y.,Writer,"Writing and Editing, Self-employed",2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,Capterra,23/03/2022,Very pleased,"I use QBO daily. I appreciate this as our main payroll and accounting system. Quickbooks easily integrates with our third-party websites and needs; eg. credit card processing, Paypal, as well as our donor base as we are a 501c3 non profit. I did not have a background in accounting or business management. Quickbooks Online made it very easy to learn how this function works. QBO Customer service always goes above and beyond assisting any needs. Minimal downtime and errors with this software. Very Happy. ","Over the years QBO has made many advancements and received customer feedback for a quicker, simpler way to run and access reports. I do not have any issues using this software. "
Andrew M.,Vice President of Operations,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 11-50 employees",2+ years,4,5,4,5,4,8,Capterra,17/02/2023,Overall it's a good bang for the buck by providing a rather robust accounting program for a mid-size non-profit.  I wish they could do multi-company consolidations all from within QuickBooks and not having to export to Excel.,"Quickbooks has great learning tools and resources to acquire knowledge on how to use their platform.  It can take some time getting used to everything (as it does with any system), but once you get the hang of it, it is generally pretty easy to navigate and set things up.","Their customer service is usually pretty helpful for the technical pieces but we had some issues with our billing and they were a complete mess to work with.  I guess as long as you are paying your bill, that's all they care about and don't want to waste their time figuring out billing issues.  Also, there are a few limitations in a some of their reports that don't seem to make sense and even stumped some of the customer service agents that I had talked to.  "
Verified Reviewer,,"Religious Institutions, 11-50 employees",2+ years,5,5,3,5,5,9,Capterra,27/11/2020,Accounting made easy even for those bookkeepers or accountants new to the software. ,"QuickBooks for nonprofits can handle small nonprofits and large ones as well. The system is easy to use and QuickBooks has a ton of guides and videos to help begins with just about anything. Truly accounting made easy, not to mention the dozens of app integrations available. ","My only complaint is when calling customer service, I have been helped by representatives who know less than I do about their program. I just hand up and call again to talk to someone else. "
jenny d.,Accountant,"Entertainment, 11-50 employees",6-12 months,4,4,4,4,4,8,Capterra,11/12/2019,"We are a multi-location theatre and school. Our directors and managers and board members need to have access to reports about each show and its success, our donations and fundraising efforts and our expenses in real-time in order to make decisions quickly. The ability of the QBO to allow this real-time access is something we have come to rely upon. The difficulty we have is with data input. We have had to hire a person just to input our deposits from our enrollment system and cc processor by hand, so that we can class them correctly. ","That it is accessible by many people in our organization in real time and that access is customizable by user. It has many of the desktop features that we like, including the ability to use a lot of classes and accounts and customizable reporting.  I love being able to have many windows of it open in order to compare between accounts or items I am working on. ","I have worked with Quickbooks since the 1990s and therefore am a desktop user. I am used to the keyboard shortcuts and the ability to upload data for invoicing, deposits and journal entries. That minimal columns can be uploaded is really frustrating and it is time consuming to hand enter items, especially if our processors don't download their data to QB. 
I do not like that I cannot use a desktop version to clean up items in the online version. I really liked the accountant versions in desktop."
Selcuk D.,Finance Director,"Investment Management, 11-50 employees",1-2 years,5,5,5,5,5,9,Capterra,08/12/2022,"The platform is incredibly intuitive and provides a wide range of features and tools that make it easy to manage finances. The reporting capabilities are comprehensive and accurate, and the cost is worth the investment. ","I have been thoroughly impressed with QuickBooks Online Advanced. The platform is incredibly intuitive and provides an array of tools and features that make it easy to manage finances. The accounting and invoicing processes are efficient and user-friendly, and the reporting capabilities are comprehensive and accurate. ","One of the drawbacks of QuickBooks Online Advanced is the cost of the subscription. While the features are worth the investment, the cost can be steep for small businesses with limited budgets. Additionally, the platform can be complicated to navigate for those with limited accounting experience."
Charles M.,Mental Performance Consultant ,"Health, Wellness and Fitness, 1-10 employees",2+ years,5,4,4,5,5,8,Capterra,04/12/2022,Experience has been great and very professional so far!,I loved how automated my invoices and billing became using quickbooks. I enjoy the professional look and easy use of the platform. It made it also easier to build and make expenses report. The customer service was also really good as I was able to schedule a call within the first 5 min on the website,"Right now, I need a bit more experience on the platform. However, I would say that the price are decent and good for what I am using. Nothing negative to say about the platform. "
Russell B.,CEO,"Accounting, 1-10 employees",2+ years,4,3,,3,2,7,Capterra,19/07/2022,It is a necessary evil. ,Online access is convenient. Most clients are already using it. Easy to get accountant access.  Bank feeds are superior to the desktop product.  Integrates with many different tools through Zapier.  Works with a large array of direct 3rd party add ins.,"It lacks basic and essential features such as reliable backup/restoration of data, month end closing tools, etc.  forcing us to pay third parties to make up for what QBO lacks.  The receipt capture is too limited and is very poor at matching transactions if it doesn't automatically recognize a receipt.  

The system is extremely nit picky about which type of transaction you are using in the moment.  This is not an issue with QB desktop as you can easily enter almost any type of transaction from the register without the need to tell it what you are doing in advance.

The product does not often get substantive improvements and yet the subscription fees are very high and are increasing over time. Pay more, get the same product."
Gary T.,President,"Chemicals, 1-10 employees",2+ years,3,4,3,2,3,5,Capterra,11/12/2019,"We run our business on it and have to work around all the limitations, it gets the job done, but we spend a lot of time having to use excel outside the product to get things completed.   It is getting better but so slowly we have considered moving to another online software package.","QBO is an easy to use intuitive accounting software package with generally reliable online access.  It has the basic accounting features that you would expect for a small business, but lacks the detailed features necessary for a bundled product business (one where your product is composed of Bill of Materials and you need to track the details on the sub components - think of gift baskets with 10 items in it, and the basket has a single SKU.)   QBO has been improving in many ways and priority circle is a welcome addition to getting support.

","The Reporting is really poor, you cannot simply build a report using any fields there are significant limitations of what fields you can include in a report.  For instance you cannot write a report with customer and invoice information in it.  IE.  What customers have bought what products and when - this can't be done you need to export all the data and then do your own intersection to answer that question.

There is really limited inventory tracking - as long as you stock and sell individual wigets your are ok, but if you sell bundles you are screwed.   We have to do all inventory tracking outside of QBO because it is so lacking.

You can't not do line item discounts.

You cannot have negative product line items ( like volume discounts or returns, etc.)

There are so many basic features in QBO Desktop that are totally lacking in the online version.

"
Kyle H.,Accounting,"Information Technology and Services, 1-10 employees",6-12 months,5,5,4,5,5,10,Capterra,11/12/2019,The chart of accounts feature of QBO is much cleaner than the two previously used accounting softwares. Also the reporting functions are much more user friendly for non-accounting employees trying to find financial information that makes sense to them. ,"Everything is very clean, and easy to navigate. The general features of the software are user friendly to all levels of accounting. If you have never used an accounting software before QBO makes it very accessible to find important and valuable information about your finances with relative ease.","The more in depth features do take a little time to navigate. There are also a lack to ""advance"" features for some of the functions but it overall fits the bill. There is nothing that is missing that is an absolute need for business function- just more of a ""would be nice""."
Ryan C.,Manager,"Retail, 11-50 employees",Less than 6 months,5,5,5,5,5,10,Capterra,11/12/2019,"There are so many reasons why we love working on Quickbooks online. The credit card processor working through our website, the mobile app and card processor, as well as the integration to WordPress and to help add automation to our financial recording. ","There are so many features to this software, but my favorite is definitely the online platform. I am able to see the progress of the business through my phone or iPad and not just sitting behind a desk. So much business is done on the road or moving around and having the app easily accessible I can always be in touch with what is going on in the company. ",Setting up the new company file was difficult. We were moving from QuickBooks desktop and it had to much data (20 years worth) that we were not able to compress it then upload the information to the new platform. We were able to do batch uploads which did allow us to preserve some data but it did make the transition a little more difficult than it needed to be. 
Verified Reviewer,,"Public Policy, 11-50 employees",2+ years,4,3,4,4,5,8,GetApp,15/06/2018,,Online accessibility - can work anywhere with an internet connection.  Linking to bank and credit card accounts is handy.  Linking to Bill.com and Expensify are also easy.,"As a controller and an accountant consultant on the side, I would recommend the online version to small businesses with fewer than 5-10 employees and revenues under $1 million that have very few transactions.  For companies that have multiple approval layers and AP invoices, you would need an add on app like Bill.com to handle.  We use Expensify and Bill.com to handle expense reporting and AP.  QuickBooks Enterprise edition would be a better fit for companies with more than a million in sales and more than 10 employees, but costs can add up on that platform.  
-Approval levels are very broad.  If I want to allow someone to add classes, I have to give them access to banking and reports that are only for partners to see.  Further a la carte customization for permissions would certainly be handy.
-Speed - even with high speed internet, processing multiple AP invoices is very slow compared to the desktop counterpart.  
-Accounting integration - when allowing accountants access to the company file, downloading the GL needs to go to excel.  If the GL is large, it may exceed the line limit for Excel.
-Some reports are unable to use the custom fields.  This creates problems when the custom fields are critical.  in our case, we can't run a report of payments received that includes project numbers.  In order to get that report, I need to use Zapier to extract payments as they come in and send them to a google sheet. So the only listing I have for payments listed with our custom fields is in Google sheets!"
Simon R.,President,"Marketing and Advertising, 1-10 employees",1-2 years,3,2,1,4,4,1,Capterra,12/04/2022,"Overall, if the  execution of Quickbook online would have been as good as the idea, its probably the software we would be using, but the execution is to me really terrible and we feel that the customers support really do the least to help out.","What Iiked the most about the software is the idea of having everything under one software, Quickbook is a great  ¨idea¨","We had such terrible experience with customer support. It was hard to talk to anyone and when we did they never tried to understand our situation or context. It was an experience we wish we never had.  Also once you start to use all the capability of the software you start to find all kind of limitation. We are also very disappointed that our business was not eligible to use the integrated payment processing module inside the invoice, this is the main reason we went back to our previous accounting software, Wave."
LeAnn S.,"VP, Operations","Non-Profit Organization Management, 11-50 employees",6-12 months,5,5,5,4,5,10,Capterra,11/12/2019,"We have realized much richer reporting, faster data entry and uploads, connection to multiple apps such as Bill.com, and a wealth of information readily available through QuickBooks training, online experts, and even YouTube videos.","We love that QuickBooks provides an online option that is easily accessible for all of our virtual employees and financial advisers.  It has been a breeze to use compared with our old system (Abilla MIP).  In today's digital age, we don't often need all the complexity - just the natural, simple, and efficient financial management systems.",The only thing we haven't liked is that our transition from MIP had to be done manually.  
Verified Reviewer,,"Information Technology and Services, 1-10 employees",1-2 years,4,4,3,3,3,8,GetApp,04/08/2022,Overall for bookkeeping and accounting this software is simple to use as long as you don't use other features like processing payments.,It was very easy to set up and use.  Interface is nicely laid out.  Reports are easy to find and prepare.,You are not able to create multiple invoice templates with different company names ie. one company with a numbered name and another with the business name.  Also you have no control over online payments.  Quickbooks will give you a chargeback but they won't release any info on the transaction so best not to use them for your online store.  Use another service.
prasad m.,manager,"Research, 1-10 employees",Less than 6 months,5,5,4,5,4,9,Capterra,30/05/2023,"Overall, about  QuickBooks Online Advanced my opinion is its a powerful set of features tailored to the needs of growing businesses. It provides advanced reporting, scalability, integration capabilities, and enhanced user permissions. With its robust automation and inventory management features, it can streamline  accounting processes and provide valuable insights into your business's financial health. The customer support is also good."," QUICKBOOKS ONLINE ADVANCED helped me to  create custom reports, track key performance indicators (KPIs), and generate visualizations to gain a deeper understanding of business's financial performance. Easy to set different user roles and restrictions to ensure that employees only have access to the data and features relevant to their roles.

This integration capability enables  streamline our workflows, automate tasks, and connect accounting software with other business tools support me such as CRM systems or project management platforms. I received faster response times and dedicated support from QuickBooks experts who can assist you with any issues or questions you may have. The enhanced support can be particularly beneficial for businesses that rely heavily on the software for their day-to-day operations.The inventory management features, such as tracking stock levels, creating purchase orders, and managing multiple locations.  helps businesses with complex inventory needs efficiently manage their stock, streamline order fulfillment, and prevent stock outs or overstocks.

","what i don't like about this software is it limitation to customization, you can not change this according to your specific needs. some times times you need to customize your processes  and functions to fit in to QuickBooks advance. Secondly, this is for the small to mid size organizations not for big and multinational entities. For me i had difficulty in setting up project accounting because of less options are available. it is also to note that  there is no automated procedure for fixed assets capitalization like other ERPs"
Joe M.,COO,"Wholesale, 1-10 employees",2+ years,4,4,,3,,7,Capterra,11/12/2019,We were doing all of our accounting manually before and it got to a point where we could not keep up. Now none of our upcoming expenses are a surprise and we know with great accuracy what our financial position is while we are determining if an opportunity is right for us.,I like that it is universally used so no matter how many different financial professionals from how many different companies I have to deal with they are familiar with the software so there is no learning or teaching curve there.,The biggest flaw I would say is when a new 3rd party program comes out that works well with my business Quickbooks seems to lag behind in having some kind of integration available. Ideally I would like all my softwares so integrate with Quickbooks so that I can use the full power of the system.
Michael L.,President,"Construction, 11-50 employees",2+ years,4,4,4,4,4,8,Capterra,11/12/2019,"We experience little downtime, despite some slowing of speeds.

Eugene D.,Project Manager ,"Logistics and Supply Chain, 1-10 employees",2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,9,Capterra,05/05/2022,Overall QuickBooks online advanced is a excellent product without which our business would not run as smoothly I highly recommend this product to any small business.,It is very easy to use and does not require an enormous amount of training. I especially like being able to integrate directly into our electronic data interchange system as well as our bank. QuickBooks online advanced really brings all of the useful features together to create a platform that helps our business run smoothly.,"Although the help section is very thorough, it is not as easy to navigate. I wish there was an easier way. The graphic user interface could also use a little bit of improvement in terms of placing of features to make them more intuitive."
Sabrina R.,CFO,"Real Estate, 51-200 employees",2+ years,4,5,,4,2,8,Capterra,11/12/2019,"Quickbooks Online Advanced overall has served our purpose well, especially as a small company, but as we continue to grow and with the expense increase we may need to look for other options that are more robust.  It was worth it to attempt to make the system work for the cost, but not so much anymore.",The software is easy to use and can be accessed by multiple people in multiple locations.  There are a multitude of videos available when attempting to do something new.,"The cost has increased from $30 to $150 per month, which is a major increase for what doesn't seem like a lot of extra tools.  The few things that our company needs cannot be helped with Priority Circle, we need the system to work more like desktop did.  "
Milena K.,Bookkeeper,"Accounting, 1-10 employees",2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,Capterra,13/05/2023,"I like how easy, reliable, and multi-functional QBO Advanced is. I use it for a client and it saves me time and money.",I like the many features QBO Advanced has to offer. It saves time and money. It is great for growing business. It is easy to integrate with many other apps if needed. ,"The least I like would be the price, however, with the many features it has to offer - it definitely is a must for a growing business with more complex workflows."
April F.,"Vice President, Secretary, Treasure","Restaurants, 11-50 employees",2+ years,5,5,3,5,5,10,Capterra,11/12/2019,"I am completely self taught with keeping books in my business.  Quickbooks online has made this even easier than any desktop version.  I have been using Quickbooks online since it first came out and I am pleased with the continual progress and improvements made to the system.  I feel the fees are very reasonable, but I do take advantage of  many of the features.  Payroll is the best feature.  It saves time and money.  I would never want to use an outside source unless I no longer had to do any bookkeeping myself.","Easy to set up and use.

Richard M.,Director of Operations,"Airlines/Aviation, 11-50 employees",1-2 years,4,3,5,5,5,9,Capterra,11/12/2019,,Quickbooks Online allows us to streamline our accounting process as well as inventory tracking. Our customers love to be able to receive estimates and invoices online as well as pay online. With unlimited chart of accounts and excellent reporting features we are able to monitor the pulse of the company daily. ,"If you are not an accounting guru, have access to an accountant or you do not understand debits, credits and accounting concepts you are going to feel lost. There is an extreme learning curve for small business owners who go from physical books and spreadsheets to Quickbooks Online. Once you learn everything you will find the software very helpful, but when you first get started odds are, you're going to inadvertently make a big mess of your books until you figure it all out."
Kavindu Githsara K.,System Specialist,"E-Learning, 11-50 employees",2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,Capterra,15/01/2023,"Overall, QuickBooks Online Advanced has been a valuable tool for our business. The user-friendly interface and automatic data backups have made it easy to use and the advanced reporting and inventory management features have provided valuable insights into our financial performance. While there are some limitations, such as limited customization options and higher cost, the benefits of this software outweigh the cons for our business.","As a user of QuickBooks Online Advanced, I have found it to be a reliable and user-friendly accounting software for our business. One of the biggest advantages of this software is the user-friendly interface that makes it easy to navigate. This has been a huge time-saver for my team, as we don't have to spend hours trying to figure out how to use the software. Another great feature of QuickBooks Online Advanced is the automatic data backups. Not only that, but also the advanced reporting and inventory management features have also been a great asset to our business, allowing us to track our inventory in real-time and generate detailed reports on our financial performance.",One of the downsides of QuickBooks Online Advanced is the limited customization options for invoices and purchase orders. 
Sara H.,Administrative ,"Construction, 11-50 employees",Less than 6 months,4,3,5,3,4,8,Capterra,12/12/2019,"Since switching to QBO Advance our company has not only been able to work efficient and effectively but also pinpoint trouble areas both within our financials and bookkeeping. We have been able to work towards correcting and improving these areas. Overall, we are very happy with our experience thus far with QBO Advanced. ","There are several features we find extremely convenient, including, the ability to directly connect our bank accounts, remote access to our software, and the at a glance profit and loss for projects. We also find the project feature to be the most useful and enjoy the hourly cost rate within projects to be extremely insightful. A final area we find extremely useful is the user permissions feature within QBO Advance; this feature has given us the ability to broaden our users and therefore increase our workflow efficiency without sharing our financial data. ","We have found the payroll add-on to be difficult to work with, specifically, distributing the different pay rates because our employees get paid different wages when working on government jobs as well was when they work overtime. Overtime does not seem to accurately pull from the time cards and pay appropriately for overtime. We also wish more payroll data had transferred when switching from desktop to online.  "
Beth M.,Owner and COO,"Marketing and Advertising, 11-50 employees",2+ years,5,4,,4,5,10,Capterra,11/12/2019,"Sending invoices out to clients on a recurring basis used to vex me! But invoicing with QBO is quick and simple and I can see whether the client has open/viewed the invoice. Now I can even create invoices in batches! I can send reminders, statements, and clients can pay online with credit cards or ACH, allowing cash flow to improve. I can also see AR reports and then follow up easily.","Overall this product is easy to use and offers the tracking resources our company needs. I also love the add-ons for processing payroll  and the merchant services. It is a seamless, easy process for me to process payroll at a fraction of the cost of payroll processing companies. Also, I have yet to find a per transaction cost lower that Intuit's Merchant Services, plus it cuts the amount of work I would have to do if I used an outside credit card processor. I also like that this is cloud-based, online software that I can access from any computer at home and at work (or even at a coffee shop).","When I have a question or need assistance, the customer service has not been as good as I would expect to support what is, in my opinion, such a great software. QBO Advanced, however, has upgraded with a service called Priority Circle."
Eric M.,Owner,"Construction, 11-50 employees",6-12 months,2,3,3,2,2,2,Capterra,10/02/2021,Frustrating,"Nothing really.  We used to have QB desktop and it was pretty solid, but it was clunky for our remote accountant to access the desktop version (possible, just challenging for only our accountant or we could be on the desktop version at a time).  Otherwise it the desktop version was great.","Where do I start.  Customer service knows 'zero' about the construction industry hence can't relate to questions regarding simple things such as sub-contractor W9 and certificate of insurance (COI) storage.  QB desktop has a place for input of COI storage with the addition of 'reminders' when a sub's COI expires.  The online version has nothing for this (and this is a big deal for a growing general contractor - keeping track of COI manually is a huge pain).  Also, when adding a project (location) for an Existing customer one would think you could go into an Existing customer profile to create a new project - but no, you have to create an entirely new CUSTOMER to do this, when all you are doing is adding a project to an existing Customer.  It's baffling.  Our accountant also doesn't like QB online and commented it was designed by website designers - not accountants.  I agree.  We're looking for new accounting software."
Kristen F.,Accounting Dept,"Transportation/Trucking/Railroad, 11-50 employees",6-12 months,5,5,5,4,5,10,Capterra,11/12/2019,QB Advanced has been a great addition to our workplace. I am the main user and I like the ease of reports and other functions.,"The product is user friendly. It is easy to navigate and find all the features. The tech support are always friendly, fast and always help with any questions I have had.","There are many features that we do not use, but I'm sure would be helpful to other companies."
Samantha M.,Controller,"Retail, 1-10 employees",1-2 years,4,4,5,3,3,8,Capterra,11/12/2019,"It has been good. The price is a pain, but you get a ton of features even if you dont use every single one. We have enjoyed using QBO for years and will continue to use the service. ","-The customer service is on point every time. They are super helpful and can help you with errors and questions of any sorts. Any time I have had to contact them, they are quick and helpful. They also are kind!
-New Features added all the time","- Wont save the date to the actual date. It saves the last date you put in, which can be a really huge error later if you didnt change the date and went about your day.
-Prices tripled and they did add a ton of features, they arent really used by my size company and we had to get the upgraded version for ONE feature we use, which feels like waste"
John F.,Director of Finance,"Arts and Crafts, 11-50 employees",2+ years,4,5,5,4,5,9,Capterra,11/08/2022,Overall very positive. My only gripes are listed above. They are just a few changes I'd like to see happen. Will continue using QB Online and hope to see improvements in the future!,"Online access, ease of use, and overall user friendliness. Also love that you can add attachments to each entry. Fantastic, because then I don't have to go digging in a file cabinet to find the supporting documentation.","Custom reporting could definitely be improved. You can't select from nearly the amount of data items that are necessary. Also, a great feature to add would be the option to add a single attachment to bulk transactions. I would love to see this implemented. IE: when using ""Batch Transactions"" you could add a single report to the 25 different entries made in the batch. Also, another thing would be that you can list multiple departments on one invoice/sales receipt (IE make it a line item) instead of having to generate separate invoices/SR."

David N.,CFO,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 11-50 employees",2+ years,5,5,5,4,5,8,Capterra,11/12/2019,QBO is easy to use and not because it's aimed towards inexperienced users or people who have no accounting background.

We have been able to provide advanced reporting utilizing these features. ,I wish the Advanced version had the backup feature included and wouldn't require the large additional fee to include this feature. I also wish the budgeting tool was included in the basic version and didn't require a higher level option since budgeting should be done at the basic level for any small business. I also wish the integration to Power Bi was no longer in beta so that functionality can be fully utilized.

Since it is so widely used, there are plenty of classes and tutorials available. I love the specific nonprofit features, such as classes.","Still impossible to do true fund accounting with Quickbooks. We use classes for each program and subclasses for each project, which is a lot of work but is necessary to properly track our employees' time.

I've never had a long wait time like with other sites. It is really well organized and easy to navigate. QB has so much to offer in its functionality, we're still finding new things we can use.","QuickBooks is one of the easiest programs to use. The customer service is great and very responsive, expenses are easily trackable. You have the ability to edit and make changes if things need fixed. Some programs won't allow this which can be problematic, but QuickBooks does it all. The search option is one of my favorite things, sometimes you don't have all the information, so this helps you piece it together much faster.","I really don't have any complaints about the software. We sometimes have issues with some expenses not importing into our other program we use, but I have a feeling that this is the other program's issues, not necessarily QuickBooks."

They will not help you. ,"Theoretically, it's a great idea. Great to be able to have multiple users in different locations, and it updates continuously. Being able to attach docs to each transaction is great. But unless your company is very very simple, QBO has the potential to turn into a serious mess. ","It is overly complicated, not intuitive, not easy to learn, and if a mistake is made, it turns into a nightmare. And the tech support people, although extremely nice and polite, generally don't know how to fix the problems, they put you on hold to look it up I think. The are not knowledgable, not confident about their answers. I've had them tell me to do things that made a small problem much worse, I'm now paying an accountant to try to fix the mess. I've asked for someone more knowledgable and they say there is no one. And we pay for the Advanced feature, supposedly better support. Priority Circle too. Gimmicks."

I consider it essential but some ability to add certain modules without having to increase costs by 100% would be nice.",It's easy to use and learn. It integrates with many banks making it simple to reconcile.,"Reporting needs to add more charts and graphs and the dashboard needs more widgets and customization. You get good reports at our level, but to get graphical charts you have to upgrade to the next levels which is more than 100% increase in costs. Also, modules they include are rendered useless with out others. Example: inventory. It's a great tool, but without the ability to have a role for jus tan inventory manager without doubling my costs to upgrade means I can't use it."

These features are simple to use and comprehend as well.","On sometimes, we are abruptly logged out of QuickBooks.

The functionality for reports easy is to manipulate.  Editing, uploading, and closing periods is great.  There is also some good add on's to upload entries and statements.  We use bill.com and these two programs work well together.","There is some quirky things.  Especially integrating bill.com with in with it.  Sometimes it is not so much complicated accounting but more so hard to navigate the software to make things happen the way you want.  For example, putting things through bill and trying to hit a receivable account is not possible.  Or manually entering and invoice and having it paid from a receivable account.  Little things like this."
Zarin S.,Accountant,"Hospitality, 1001-5000 employees",1-2 years,4,5,5,5,3,6,Capterra,11/12/2019,"Overall, it is a great software for smaller companies. Maybe because my company is rapidly growing, QuickBooks may no longer be a good fit for it. I think it's very easy to use for anyone, even people who don't have bookkeeping or accounting experience. QuickBooks should work on fixing the frequent glitches and errors. ","I like that the software is very easy to use and user-friendly. When I joined my company, I had no prior experience to using any kind of accounting/bookkeeping software and had no issues with picking up on QuickBooks easily. Pretty simple to pull the information you need, ideal for a small-to-medium sized company.","My biggest complaint with this software has to be the glitches. My company heavily relies on QuickBooks and it is a daily part of my work. We often have issues with QuickBooks not loading properly, getting error messages such as ""504 Gateway Time-out"", having to switch between the desktop app and the browser version because one or the other is not working. Because these issues impede on my daily work, I can't give this software a higher rating. "

You can do multiple things as invoicing, financing, inventory management, payments, estimates etc. And the best part is it works on the cloud, so you can work from anywhere and from any device you like.",No option to edit multiple items at same time. If you want to change only one letter of 100 product's name you have to edit all of them 1 by 1. Also in search bar it finds only if you write in correct order. It would be nice to find product with writing any part of it's name.
Devin B.,CEO,"Wholesale, 1-10 employees",6-12 months,5,5,5,5,5,10,Capterra,08/12/2022,It was easy to implement and setup.,We love the ease of use that the product offers.,We don't have anything we don't like about the product.
Christine A.,staff accountant,"Accounting, 11-50 employees",2+ years,4,3,5,5,5,7,Capterra,06/12/2022,Overall it is a great software IF you know what you are doing. I wouldn't recommend for new business owners unless there is proper training provided. It has a lot of useful features that other software don't offer. I do think the pros outweigh the cons.,It is nice having all the business information at your finger tips. The automation and bank syncs saves hours of time because transactions don't have to be manually entered. It is easy to generate and customize reports.,I don't like that QuickBooks bank feeds try to automatically match transactions. The bank feed center could be improved. It's easy to incorrectly match items. I also don't like running inventory and invoicing through here. It is very easy to get Accounts Receivable and the inventory account messed up. I've had several issues with clients not matching the correct payments to the correct invoices.

Neha T.,Tax Consultant,"Management Consulting, 10,001+ employees",2+ years,3,4,3,3,4,7,GetApp,19/06/2018,,"Quick books are an all in one solution. It is accessible from anywhere .It's simple user interface makes it easy for even entry level professionals. It creates invoices and receive payments at one go. It has multiple interesting features like automatic mileage tracking, business expense tracking & quarterly tax estimates which makes one' s life easier. One of the best features is the payroll feature, everything is integrated so it doesn't take long and is calculated for you.",It is perfect for entry level but for growing businesses it lacks advanced features. It has very basic features which lacks advanced & necessary features like depreciation tables & footnotes below financial statements. Reports generated also lacks formatting options and unable to do detailed customization. For example one cannot find a detailed transaction report or summary report.
Maurice T.,Accounting Supervisor,"Philanthropy, 11-50 employees",2+ years,5,5,4,5,3,9,SoftwareAdvice,12/10/2017,User friendly.," QB Nonprofit desktop is easy to use with its flexibility and options which includes name search for customers and vendors and its versitility in financial statements.  The classes allow us to get financial statements by class or department which are also very useful. Along with our main department (church) we also have 2 schools, so the software allows us to get financial statements for just the schools.  We also use the budgets and get financial statements that show comparisons to budget projections.  Dollar to dollar and percentage comparisons. Budgets are easy to prepare.  Numbers that are exactly to same from month to month can just be copied across the entire year and don't have to be entered into each month individually.

As I grow our company's accounting department, new hires with no previous experience using QuickBooks Online Advanced have also found it simple to pick up and use on a daily basis.

The standard reports available cover the majority of my needs, but the ability to generate custom reports allows me to dissect the data at a finer level.  I also utilize the functionality of QuickBooks Online Advanced to autorun reports and email them directly to my team.  This has resulted in a faster workflow as we automate certain aspects that previously bottlenecked with a single individual.","There are minor autofill aspects that could be more accurate.  For example, when using a copy of a journal entry  to generate a new journal entry at times the dates will autofill to next year instead of next month (e.g. July 2020 instead of August 2019).  This is a minor issue that be quickly overcome."

Jeremiah L.,Controller,"Education Management, 51-200 employees",2+ years,3,2,4,3,4,6,Capterra,02/05/2022,,"The best thing about QuickBooks Online Advanced is the price. As a SMB that has over 100 employees and generates +$12 million in revenue, the software package that is included is inexpensive as compared to other ERP/Accounting software passages.","The worst thing about QuickBooks Online Advanced is the discontinuity that exists within the platform. Everything seems to operate in a segregated manner so it is easy to get working in one section of the platform, but it is not simple to transition to another from within a section. The platform is by no means complete because there are many features that are missing and either require an integration with a 3rd party application or a need to purchase another software altogether."
Sondra C.,Owner,"Accounting, 1-10 employees",2+ years,1,1,1,1,1,0,Capterra,06/11/2020,Not Good,the fact that I could access it from anywhere,Customer support was terrible.  My clients found it not user friendly and I have taken most of them off of it.  When it was converted back to the desktop it took me 4 months to clean up the mess.  They obviously don't want you to go back to the desktop.  Doing a bank reconciliation is more complex than the desktop version.  There was a problem with the AZ withholding and they have never fixed it.  Payroll is geared to them doing it all.  Reports are harder to customize. Overall I hated it.  
Jonni E.,Program Manager,"Electrical/Electronic Manufacturing, 51-200 employees",2+ years,5,4,,4,,8,Capterra,11/12/2019,We are using it for basic business functions like entering customer sales order and sending purchase orders to suppliers.,"My company uses QuickBooks to track vendors and enter customer sales order and to send purchase orders to suppliers.   But I myself only use it for purchasing so I will restrict my comments to that area only. 

I think in general it handles the basics very well.  Advanced Search function is adequate. It searched well if you use something like vendor name.  Does not seem to work very well if you are searching just be reference. ",It's tedious to enter an item on every line.  It would be AMAZING if you could develop an upload template in excel that would allow us to populate many line items.

Laura R.,Digital Strategist,"Marketing and Advertising, Self-employed",Less than 6 months,4,5,5,3,4,8,Capterra,11/12/2019,"Overall, Quickbooks Online can replace the accounting software of most small-to-medium businesses. It's easy to use and fast. You can use Quickbooks Online from anywhere, any device, at any time. That's a big deal. I love having the ability to browse it on my computer and then, when I need to, bring it up on my phone when I'm at the coffee shop or with a client. Intuit hit it out of the park with this app.","The best feature is easily the sales tracking. It's easy to create quotes, turn them into sales orders, and then onto invoices.

Widely used by other companies, so able to get advice from our accountant and others online.
The ease with which we can reconcile accounts.","Somewhat ""glitchy"" - for example, when we record a payment by ""check"", QB doesn't hold the ""check"" designation. So no ""type of payment"" is recorded. All other payment forms work.
It's not always that intuitive to find the way to do things. Like getting a refund check from a vendor takes way more steps than it really should. And it's not very intuitive.
I wish you could run a batch of memorized transactions without having to exit and re-open the program. And maybe there is . . . but if there is, it's not intuitive as to how.
I would like to switch to the online version, but it doesn't have all the same features that I have in my desktop version."

i wish the GL report would display as my default preference instead of making me change it everytime.

I hate that i can only see one year's worth of outstanding invoices on the invoice screen.  why cant it just show me all o/s from all time as of today?

My least favorite things is the limited number of tags you can put on a transaction.  For example the only way you can tag a transaction is by account and class.  I need at least 2 more tags to do everything i need.  "

Haley W.,Membership and Operations Manager,"Philanthropy, 1-10 employees",2+ years,3,5,,3,2,3,SoftwareAdvice,04/12/2018,"Unless you really need the non-profit specific features, just get Quickbooks premier and choose non-profit as your industry. You'll get some of the customization of the non-profit version and save money. ","It changes some of the standard Quickbooks features to be non-profit specific, like changing invoices to be called pledges and renaming some reports. That can be helpful so everyone (staff, board, accountant, auditor, etc) is on the same page when talking about things. ","Regular Quickbooks is cheaper. If your accountant uses Quickbooks and your organization uses Quickbooks Non-profit, they can't export your data and work on it with their software, they'll have to use yours. "

It helps me manage my day to day business operations and it has everything in the software to benefit my business and to help me stay on track.  Also another important feature I like about this software is the fact I can track my sales and sales tax.  I have to keep track of that to ensure I pay the correct amount of sales tax at year end.,I am fairly a new user to this software and still have a lot to learn.  The thing I like the most is the online support.  If I ever need help my questions get answered quickly!  I like the marketing automation tool the best!  It allows me to get other stuff done on time and I love the quick reminders so I will not forget stuff I have to take care of!  Also the uploads and imports features work extremely fast as far as processing than other software programs I have used.,"I think I was overwhelmed by a lot of features it offers and the time it takes me to get through them all.  Sometimes I get confused on what to use for what I need.  But as a newbie less than 7 months it just takes some time to get use to.  I use the main functions like the manage cash flow, track miles, and manage and pay bills.  The only other con is the cost, it is a little pricey!"

Amy R.,Office administrator,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 1-10 employees",2+ years,5,5,5,4,5,9,Capterra,08/05/2020,It saves me time compared to what we were using before.  The help search feature almost always has answers to solve my problem.  ,"The desk top version is economical for our purposes.  The reports are easy to produce for our board, and the file can be easily shared with our accountant. ","I'm sure we could be using project management and budgeting features better but with so many separate projects going on at the same time with different start and end dates, I haven't been able to find a way to do this.

So changes must be made to each individual invoice and/or message.  Insane.

Quickbooks is by no means bad software, but as a paying user I feel they get more value out of you than you get out of the product given the alternatives available.","Quickbooks has all the functionalities you need in accounting software, it's compatible with multiple systems, has a decent design and styling and makes it easy to collaborate with accountants.","The company behind Quickbooks takes a marketing-first approach, which probably works well for them in terms of revenue but I feel leaves the product worse of than it could be. What this means in practice is that you'll be hit with offers, discounts and deals at every step of the way trying to get you to pay or pay more, while at the same time it's often difficult to find the functionality you need within the UX. The UI is needlessly complex, making it hard at times to derive maximum value out of the product.

We used this for the basic finances and IRS related things. But when it came to getting fancy we used Excel and some other programs. I don't think Quickbooks Reports are all the impressive either.

I appreciate how user friendly it is and that I have the option to customize the results of the reports to my preference. The formatting of the Excel spreadsheet is easy on the eyes and well organized. ,It would be nice if the Excel version of the Transaction Summary reports included formulas. Occasionally I have to add lines or move lines to different groups and I then have to manipulate the totals or add formulas myself.

I can set the date for the next payroll to occur immediately after I finish the last payroll. It's close to being fully automated! Then all I have to do is make sure the state and federal taxes are being taken out and printing/emailing paystubs to employees. ,Learning how to fix problems when they come up is difficult. I usually have to call in and have someone help me - and they don't always have the answers I'm looking for.

That this is the case is simply an outrage and though there are dozens of online reviews flagging this issue, the company remains oblivious to the hundreds of small businesses that it has abandoned to whatever they can find to make the issue better again.

I find a good reporting module will allow free-form reports to be generated on ANY and ALL information that is contained in the database.  Unfortunately, QuickBooks only allows the client to use pre-designed reports that are specific to the data they determine to be relevant for reports.  Yes, some messaging can be performed on those reports; however, the data can not be customized.  From a client perspective, there are times that an audit of certain data (parameters) that drive how the system will ultimately function, would be of enormous benefit.  Also, the client definitely has specific report desires beyond what QuickBooks' programmers have pre-determined would meet their needs.  Bottom line:  If the client is allowed to input data, the client should be allowed to print that data via reports, while structuring how they want that data to appear on those reports.",Everything except the reporting module.,The reporting module.
