He’d always chew on his butt it didn’t matter what kind of dog food I put him on. He had no hair back there. After a few weeks he had stopped itching completely ! And he’s got his hair growing back. My mom ordered this dog food to try out and I’ll never go back to the old stuff! Amazing dog food.,

But, get your act together, Amazon!","If you're here you know this is one of the best dog food brands money can buy. The hi pro plus variety specifically is nutritionally dense, easy on the dog's stomach, and good for all life stages. They love this food. But, Amazon was selling it at a specific price which nearly doubled overnight. Fine. But now it cannot be delivered in 2 days, it takes weeks. If you're going to sell pet food and expect people to be repeat customers then there is a responsibility that comes along with that. Switching dog food abruptly because Amazon can't deliver a new bag for nearly 2 weeks is a bad position to be in for any pet owner. So be warned you should order a month ahead of time. There's no other way to prepare for Amazon's delivery and supply issues that occur without warning and with disregard for pets and their owners that have come to rely on Amazon. 5 stars for the food. 1 star for Amazon. Be better, Amazon.",19

My complaint is not with the food but rather the shape it was in when it arrived. I ordered the 40lb bag. The bag arrived ripped open and taped back up with packing tape. I was buying the smaller bags without issues but now that my puppy has tripled in size I switched to the larger bag. I don’t like the idea of it having been opened. There isn’t anywhere near where I live to buy this food but it might be worth the extra drive if the bigger bags are going to arrive damaged.,5

He is a Certified Service Dog and when not working he is full of high energy. Which is great and so nice to see him run and play..

It's made in America and only one of two dog foods that has never had a recall. I usually feed them Victor select beef meal and brown rice formula. I have used Victor classic before. I like switching back and forth occasionally. but I must have got a bad bag or something because all of my dogs got diarrhea from it this time. And I just ordered two bags of it because the price dropped to $34 for a bag instead of $45. When I ordered I wondered if maybe they were trying to get rid of some expired or old dog food. So now that my dogs all got diarrhea from it I am thinking that it's either old or expired. Or close to expiring. This has never happened with Victor select and even this Victor classic. Now I'm afraid to switch them to Victor classic in the future. I have a second bag that's still waiting to be used from that $34 deal. I just reordered a bag of Victor select and will get them back on that so I can get the stools hard again. Loose stools is a big problem for one of my dogs not being able to express her anal glands and she smells like fish.,15

After his annual checkup we're asked to give him regular non grain-free food (you can read grain-free and heart disease in dogs online). It is surprisingly difficult to find premium food with grain! My dog also has allergy to something so I try to limit ingredients. Last bag was CANIDAE PURE Real Salmon and was good for his skin, but it was grain free.

He could barely walk on his back legs, limping and hopping all the time, he could not go up or down steps at all, and he rarely sat down because of the discomfort. I switched him to Victor's grain free senior food (I also give him a Phycox supplement each day, and he gets an Adequan injection every 6 weeks in alternate hips) and after 3 months he was like a different dog. I am tearing up as a write this now, this food saved his life. Six months later now, not only does he run around and play like the puppy he is, he can sit STRAIGHT! He doesn't even cock his hips out! It honestly feels like a miracle. The vets told me he would never get better than he was at 18 months, that I could only try to make his short life comfortable with pain medication and supplements. But this food changed that. He can jump on my bed again, and play with his golden retriever sister. This is the first time I have used grain free food, and all of my other pets have been switched over now. I am a believer! This product is AMAZING if your dog has mobility issues! UPDATE: Now 18 months since I put him on this food, he is doing even better. The vets are amazed and I am thrilled. He is almost too healthy now, I can't keep up!",71

I haven't actually eaten any of this, so I can't really chime in as per taste, but considering Stitch does not like lettuce, but will eat this food has to speak for something. I personally like lettuce and think he's crazy, but he humps other dog's heads and is kinda scared of balloons so I can't really use logic as an explanation. Anywhooo... This food is basically all my fur baby has eaten and he's all big and strong. Picture is a before and after kinda thing. Legit...

This dog food contains the whole grain sorghum; this grain is high in nutritional value. It is gluten free, easy to digest, and it helps maintain an even blood sugar level. Sorghum is high in antioxidants, high in fiber, and vitamin B2; as well vitamin B1, B3 (Niacin), Iron, and Zinc. It is NOT a bad grain, and nothing like corn, soy, or wheat, ALL of which should be avoided if at all possible. I bought this food because its cost was reasonable; it is grain and gluten free; it has a good standing with Dog Food Advisor; and the kibble is small, which my dogs prefer. (It was delivered quickly.) With all of this said, I must give it 4 stars because my dogs don’t like is as well as they do other grain/gluten free dog foods, and taste is part of my reason for my choosing to stay with a dog food. My dogs must enjoy their food. They don’t eat this food with the same robust joy that they have for other dog foods that I have purchased. (I use the following point system for choosing a dog food; 1 - Its standing with Dog Food Advisor must be 4 or 5 Stars; 2 - It must be grain free/gluten free; 3 - The kibble must be small and easy for my dogs to eat; 4 - My dogs like the food; and 5 - Its cost.) Will I buy this food again, maybe. If I find another food with the same criteria as this one I may switch back and forth, so that my dogs have a verity. If I find a food that they enjoy more that meets my other requirements, I will go with that food. I have found foods they like better, but they missed on some of the other factors, (They are not listed as high on the Dog Food Advisor, or they kibble is to large, or they are not grain or gluten free.) I did buy one food that was high on my listing, but its smell was just to much to handle, and it left my dogs with bad breath. So even though it rated high by my standards, I doubt I will purchase it again.",30

She has had consistent ear infections for about 6 months and we could not figure out the reason why until someone at a local pet store mentioned that it might be the potato so commonly found in many dog foods these days. He explained that because potatoes are starches that convert to sugars in the body, excess starches will feed the yeast commonly found in the ear, and cause it to overpopulate, resulting in an ""infection"". Thinking back, the ear infections started a couple of weeks after we switched her to a salmon and sweet potato dog food, so I was curious to see if switching her food again might help. I asked around, and a friend recommended Victor, so I went ahead and purchased a bag to try out. We did a very short switch over, just about 3 days, combining the remainder of her other food with the Victor. I would normally do more like a week, but we were actually almost out of her other food. I was afraid that this would cause digestions/bowel issues because she has had trouble with any new food we have tried for the switch over period and sometimes for several days with just the new food. We had zero issues with Victor! She has also cleared the ear infection, so we will see if they stay at bay without potato and other extra starches in her food! Bonus for me is that Victor is a local Texas brand, and I love supporting locally made products!",15

I was recently told about Victor brand and decided to give it a try. I JUST ordered the 5 lb bag (to test it) last night and it already arrived by this afternoon! So there's a huge and unexpected plus. As soon as I opened the shipping envelope, my pupper went wild sniffing at the bag. I opened it and was surprised to see such tiny kibbles. They looked like little rabbit turds. But, they didn't smell any more offensive than any other dog food I've handed, so I scooped out a handful and let him have them. He gobbled the entire bit and then looked at me for more. Sprinkled some in his food bowl where his SD has been sitting all day, untouched, and it disappeared. That was several hours ago. His stool is fine, no stomach upset, and his kibbles can double as treats!! We'll see how it goes with this small trial bag, but if there's no problems, I'm going to make the switch permanent. I have already researched Victor and I loved everything I found out about them AND their foods. Plus, this stuff is cheaper than his current kibble!! Will update this review if anything changes or goes wrong, but so far we're pretty happy with it. Update 5/23: I'm sold. It hasn't been very long but Victor has won me (AND my dog) over. When I contacted the company with questions, they replied immediately and made sure my every concern was addressed. They were polite and friendly the entire time. My pup LOVES his food and he's even begun filling out a bit. Before on the SD he would nibble, but he was never an enthusiastic eater. He LOVES meal times now and cleans his bowl to a Straight-From-The-Package shine every time. He's got tons of energy and he is always happy.

We then switched to Blue which was the food we used to give our other husky. He ate it, but not enthusiastically. We tried another brand we purched at Costco but he felt the same about it. He has had stomach issues since we adopted him (terrible gas and very soft stool and sometimes diarrhea). Our sitter who has experience in arctic breeds, reccomended Victor and another brand. We purchased the 5 lb bag just to try it. We mixed it with the current food we were feeding him and he devour it! He absolutely loves this food! And as a side bonus ....no more stinky gas! His stools are normal and solid. We have been reading on Victor and the company and we are sold! Ordering the bigger bag!",9

She loves it so much better then the starter food we gave her of Kibbles n Bits. The ingredeants are fresh and great quality to. Love that its made in the USA. She has so much more energy and it smells like kibble you would get at a high quality pet store or vet and is so much healthier for her. I get the Hi pro classic food 15 pound bag because she is 30 pounds and eats a cup of it a day mixed with a half a cup of homemade food. I am ok with it having very little vedges and no fruit because I always make her homemade food with fruit and vedges and even give her half of a 1/8th cup of vedges and extra fruit to make the 10% limit dogs need a day and I even add 2 pinches of real salmon mixed with apple cider viniger for omega threes and iron. She wants to eat the kibble part way more then she ever has and I know she is eating healthy to. I recomend this for working/ active and hi energy breeds because this is great to satisfy there needs. It only took me 3 days to transition her to it and no problems along with her always having a digestive probiotic with each meal to prevent bloat helped her transition easier. This is 4 for ingreedants because it has no fruit and very little vedges in the kibble but is ok due to homemade food added. 4 stars for money due to its a bit pricey but hey you pay more for healthy food. You get what you pay for. Would recomend for working/active and hi energy breeds of dog.,3

My vet asked me to compare phosphorus and magnesium to our regular puppy food and this one definitely meets the requirements. She did caution me on using it with our adult dogs simply because it is calorie dense and can cause some weight gain if you feed them a normal amount compared to other dog foods. The one draw back I found is that it makes our puppies’ poop smell like something died in the room! We potty box train our puppies when they are too little to run outside for their potty breaks and wow…. We had to keep crazy on top of picking up the poop and getting it all of the way out of the house immediately. Definitely a practice we strive to do anyway, but major extra motivation here!",5

He’s a large breed so the doc had me switch to an adult formula with some added requirements which was high protein. This hit the mark of grain-free for us. And before you light me up for heart disease, we have our reasons for choosing grain free but we’re cautious in avoiding those brands well known for creating issues in dogs. So everyone calm down—I KNOW. But if you’re here then you’re looking for grain-free and my pup has always done SO WELL with this brand. He seems allergic to the salmon recipe but we switch around some of the flavors to give him variety and the recipes are close enough it doesn’t upset his tummy. Shipping is great. Our last bag did come ripped apart and quite a bit spilled out but that’s the risk of shipping. The box was pretty ripped up.

His coat is shiny, he’s extremely active, never any stomach issues or gas and has normal bowels. I recommend this brand to anyone that asks. My only issue is how tiny the pebbles are compared to my large breed with his large jowls, although I’m sure it’s just me seeing such a big dog eating it that has me thinking the food is too small. He seems to enjoy it as I said though. Never over eats and his weight never fluctuates. Gentle on his teeth and he doesn’t eat it as fast as I’ve seen him tear up other food brands on play dates when he steals his guests’ food. It’s like having a meal vs junk food. He’ll eat and be content then come back for more when he is ready. With other brands he’ll scarf it down, poop or puke it out then be miserable and hungry again within half an hour. Point is, it’s all he is allowed to eat for a reason, it’s good for him and he enjoys it.",20

I had never heard of this and wanted to caution readers of this review to do their own research regarding this issue as it pertains to other breeds. What I like about the Victor Multi-Pro dog food is that it is devoid of these ingredients. Apparently it is very difficult to find dry foods or treats that do not include these key ingredients. The somewhat recent emphasis on grain free dog diets has led to an increase in the use of peas and potatoes which has made finding a dry dog food more difficult. The AKC has not made any conclusive claims but their caution was enough to make me pay attention and search for a recipe devoid of these ingredients. My dog loves the food but then again he loves all food. He is a foodie and I’m happy for that! Hope this helps so that all dogs may remain safe💝🐶💕",54

I had them on the Nutra Pro from victor and they did fine and ate it happily. Since they are in rapid growth stage I wanted to lower the protein and calcium/phosphorus level a bit. So I rotated to the professional which in the past I've never had a dog refuse. The puppies refuse to eat it other than a nibble here and there. I've even tried it with the Nutra Pro mixed in and they will just pick the Nutar Pro kibble out and leave this behind. I understand they changed their formula but the meat content is still high and looks to be a good formula. Perhaps I just got a bad bag. I am giving 3 stars because not even the mother dog would touch it and she will eat anything. If you have large/ giant puppies I can enthusiastically recommend the Nutra Pro but not this one at this time.,4

They are picky eaters. Won't eat the cheap HEB dog food, but will eat the higher quality, heritage ranch. Yeah, they're a little picky. So, looking for other alternatives, i tried this, and i thought the kibble size was a little big for puppies, but it crumbled very easily. It's extremely soft for a dry dog food, so even my puppies had no problem eating it despite the size of the kibble. I read some of the other reviews but, every dog loved this food, and my dogs range from beagle, ckcs, to poodle. All loved it. None of them have experienced diarrhea. And, one of my dogs is over 8 and this was the first bag they've ever had of this brand, and zero issues. So, i don't know why everyone was like it gave their dog diarrhea unless, well, Amazon wasn't keeping it in a proper storage environment or they improperly introduced their dog to the kibble. I don't know, but 5 dogs, a range in breed, range in ages, 0 issues with any of them and they all seem to enjoy the food. Finally, i also read the bag stank when they opened it - i didn't smell anything when i opened mine. So, based on them being a USA company, the reaction of my dogs... I will be purchasing this food again.",13

We tried omitting various ingredients, we tried expensive foods, we tried cheap foods, and he had the worst poop on all of them. I never thought I would spend so much time analyzing a dog's feces, yet here I was. A few people suggested this brand and we gave it a shot. Because his tummy was so unhappy on the previous food we didn't even do the two-week changeover, we started him on this one evening and by the next day there was significant improvement in his poop. Nice and solid, and he does not go as often as he used to either. He loves the flavor and even uses this kibble as a treat. We have been using this for about a month-and-a-half now and I am keeping my fingers crossed that they never change the formula. We love the ingredients and how happy his tummy is.

One of my staffies for the last year has had a lot trouble with her back legs because of arthritis, and spends a lot of time in bed. When she was up, she would hop like a rabbit instead of using both back legs to walk. We have tried everything including pain meds, dasiquin etc but nothing has seemed to help. I purchased this with no real expectations. After 4 days I was amazed that she has started to use both back legs individually instead of hopping like a rabbit. Yes she is still stiff but she has been spending more time up and about instead of in bed. I can't wait to see what a month of using this product will be. We rescued her a little over 3 years ago, and she was very abused. She deserves the rest of her life to be happy and out of pain.",76

I already knew that he'd been slowing down and gaining weight, but the arthritis diagnosis (and the realization that he was probably in a lot of pain) made me stop and take notice of what I was feeding him. I looked at the fine print on his dry food, and realized that the kibble I was feeding him was too high in calories and wasn't really appropriate for the needs of an inactive elderly dog. I went online and found Victor Senior Healthy Weight Dry, which was highly regarded both by Amazon customers and an independent pet food review website. I gave it a shot. Tomorrow marks 11 weeks since I switched my dog to Victor for one meal a day. (He eats it for breakfast and then gets canned Wellness stew for dinner.) I didn't have any trouble switching him to this food; even though it's much lower in calories than his previous kibble, he loves the taste. We've had fantastic results: he's lost 10 percent of his body weight, and he's moving more easily and more quickly. I'm honestly surprised that the results have been so fast and so dramatic. Highly recommend.",36

We also let our older 13 year old dog eat it as well. The difference was amazing. We had thought that we were going to lose our old dog that year and within a few months she became much more active and healthier. We started getting the Victor dog food senior healthy weight because she is not as active as she used to be and we were afraid of her getting fat. And she still has the same healthy reaction as she did with the puppy dog food that we first gave her. So from now on my family swear by Victor.

Unemployed and widowed failed foster Mama who thinks no one will love my fur babies and treat them as loved and spoiled as me but can’t afford expensive with a zillion animals so many many prayers and fingers crossed!!",4

My dog LOVES IT and my 2 year old yellow lab prefers this over his purina brand (not sure if it’s because it’s my GSD food and not his just yet). Did some dog food searching and when I found this brand I was skeptical because I have never heard of it and the few bad reviews I had read. Decided to try it anyways because of the protein ratio. Glad I did. My GSD never skips a meal and always finishes. He’s super energetic. People complain that their dog is “shitting” more... well, it’s high in protein and just like humans if you eat a lot of protein, you’ll poop a lot more. Just make such it’s consistent. Doesn’t matter actually how many times a day as long as it’s regular. Honestly that’s all I have to say. Looking forward to trying out the salmon and sweet potato especially because of allergies this time of year. Should help his skin/coat :).",31

For my giant breed puppy it also has the perfect amount of protein(30%) and calcium(1.4%). Calcium/phosphorus ratio is good too(1.4/1.0). A lot of people don't realize how important this is for the larger breeds. You do NOT want the larger breeds to grow too fast. This is terrible for their joints and increases their chance of developing hip dysplasia or elbow problems. You want a steady, sustained growth for these big guys(and gals). I know some of you want them to be as big as possible, but don't worry, they will get as big as they can regardless of the rate of growth. The most important thing is that, when they do reach their full size, they are able to enjoy their life happily and pain free. I had a Rottie in the 90s that was severely dysplastic and, trust me, you don't want to see your dog suffer like that. Yes, this was before I knew about the importance of growth rate. Anyway, point is, this is the perfect dog food for you large/giant breed owners. Another plus is his poop is much more solid and consistent(pugs too)...pretty smelly, though...lol. I had them on Taste of the Wild before this and their poop was much softer(and still smelly anyway). That food also had good nutrient levels, but this seems to be better for my dogs digestion.

She hates it, will only eat a few pieces when she gets really hungry, otherwise she won't touch it. It makes her throw up actually. When she first tried it she ate it a little more and I was hopeful after she refused to eat any of the 4Health food from Tractor Supply but once she started throwing up she didn't want anything more to do with the Victor food either. She is otherwise acting perfectly fine so I thought I'd give it a few days to see if she would adjust to it but now she just isn't eating it at all. She has only had Taste of the Wild and Whole Earth Farms in the past and she loves those but I was looking for something with less peas and beans/legumes but if she won't eat it, it won't do her any good. If she liked this Victor food and it didn't make her throw up I would have rated it 4 or 5 stars. As it is I have requested a refund. Now I see a lawsuit against Taste of the Wild for having enormous amounts of lead in it and Whole Earth Farms is now owned by Purina and has a lot of peas/legumes which may cause heart problems. So hard to find a good dog food that won't poison her, give her heart disease and cause me to have to sell my house to afford it. Glad I only have one 20 pound dog and a small cat. For now I will just have to go back to Taste of the Wild if I can verify the lead content issue is fixed or Whole Earth Farms so she has something to eat. Honestly, Taste of the Wild was her favorite and she seemed the healthiest eating that but it has lead in it?! Holy smokes!! Whole Earth Farms was ok and less expensive than Taste of the Wild and hasn't had tons of lead found in it (yet) so that might be the one for now.",2

Great food, great value, great poop. I can’t vouch for the taste myself, but my dogs love it. I wish the value bag was 30 pounds instead of 40 (they even have 50). If you’ve got two dogs, even big dogs, you’re not going to use a 40 pound bag fast enough, especially if you don’t store the food properly, especially in summer. The food starts degrading as soon as you open the bag. I’ve got a freezer now to store it. Taste of the Wild gets it right with 15 and 30 pound bags. (Also, my physician father is always telling me not to lift more than 30 pounds.)",One

My big boy is happy with it, my wallet can afford it, and it gets good ratings on the nutritional sites I refer to. Unfortunately the delivery is less than optimal, as the “your order was delivered” message tells me the package was left by front door or porch (which is unseen from the road due to my privacy fence), when in fact it was just left sitting in the driveway in full view and easy reach of passers by.

She had skin conditions, lesions between her toes, fungal infections, sores on her nose. Basically she had a suppressed immune system from garbage quality food. After much research I finally found several foods that didn't contain a bunch of crap dogs don't eat: corn, grain, rice, etc. But they were not cheap. This food is also not cheap, but it is the cheapest I found with high quality protein, high protein percentage, and is not contaminated with fillers like corn, grains, etc. I see a lot of owners complaining about gastrointestinal issues with their dogs on this food. I was worried my pup would suffer from the same issues, but I am pleased to say she had zero issues switching to this food. Perhaps sneaking cat poop treats helped her maintain healthy gut bacteria. It has been a week and her skin is starting to clear up. Her fungal infections no longer stink, and her lesions are healing. No dry food is 100% sufficient as a nutritional supplement, but this food is the only brand that I've found so far that seems to improve my dogs health, and that she actually enjoys eating. She hates vegetables Good luck hope this helps people",7

When I brought him to the vet for a check up, my vet told me I need to put him on a grain-inclusive diet. And that’s when the fun began🙄 He is now over 6 months old and has switched between at least 3-4 different brands of kibble including a half raw diet. These included Nutro, Diamond Naturals, and TOTW. All of them along with half raw gave him horrible gas and diarrhea. This kibble was going to be the last thing I tried before I took him back to the vet for a consultation on food. God must have been listening because this food fixed all of his issues within a day of introducing it into his diet. Since he is still considered a puppy in terms of nutrition, I am feeding the amount for his target adult weight instead of current and he is doing spectacular. His stools although very dark, are consistently solid with low odor and his energy levels are stable. I am so incredibly happy with this food! And so is Shoka!",13

But our GSD just wouldn't eat them. We switched to Victor Hi-Pro Plus (a different variety) earlier this year and she gobbled it up, so we thought we had a winner. However, she had a serious side-affect with it causing terrible constipation. I mean her stools were almost rock hard - it was crazy. They would literally crumble. We started adding a lot of water to mix in, but it made zero difference. I searched the internet to see if anyone else was reporting similar issues, but did not find anything, so guessed it was a bad batch as I've never seen anything so unnatural. We contacted Victor about this to alert them (in case other owners might be reporting similar issues), but unfortunately they did not respond. Still, we get it, sometimes thing slip through the cracks, and we tried this Victor Beef Meal &amp; Brown Rice formula because it had less protein (still a good amount, but not as much as found in Hi-Pro Plus), and her stools are better, though I think they are on the cusp - if they were any more firm, I would switch to something else. We still mix in a lot of water, and we also have added in omega oils to her meals. We're on our second bag of the Beef Meal &amp; Brown Rice formula and the experience has been consistent. She still likes it very much, and her stools seem to be ok (not soft, but not too firm either). Anyway, for now, this is our go to, and just glad to find something she likes.",4

I've done the research, and feel that I am making an educated/informed choice when I feed my dogs Victor brand dog kibble. My dogs (5) have no problems eating whatever I feed them. That being said - my foremost concern is the ingredients of the dog food I choose, and Victor meets my standards. No corn, wheat or soy to begin with. No mystery meat ""by products"". The addition of prebiotics, probiotics , omegas 3 &amp; 6- is always a plus for any dog food I choose. I rotate flavors Victor offers -with each order (beef, lamb, chicken, Hi Pro, professional) depending on which percentage of protein/fat/carbs/etc my dogs need at the time. For instance -When the weather &amp; season permits, my dogs get a good amount of exercise. Then is when I buy a higher percentage protein, fat and k/cal to keep them at an acceptable weight. Victor offers a variety of kibble for basically each season- so I do not have to go thru the two week ""changing of the dog food"" routine. For instance - My dogs do not have any problems when I change from the Beef &amp; rice formula to the Hi-Pro formula. I actually do recommend Victor dog food to anybody who asks my opinion. Presently - I am involved with a rescue. I evaluate dogs rescued (prior to being placed with a foster), rehabilitate the rescues if needed, and foster my fair share of the rescues. ( three of my 5 dogs are ""foster fails"") -So I have plenty of human/dog hours under my belt.",39

In addition, I always leave dry cat food out for any stray/feral cats. My 2 indoor pet cats are very picky. The main food they love is the canned Wysong cat/dog food. The thing I don't like about that food is cats and dogs have different nutritional needs plus they don't add vitamins. Still, it can be part of their diet, I just try to get them to also eat a highly nutritious dry food as well. As far as the Victor, they like it okay but don't love it. So, I'm planning to try a different dry food for them, probably Evanger's. As far as the strays - Previously, I was leaving out dry Purina cat food. They still looked skinny and just not very healthy. Around 2 months ago, I just decided I'd only feed them Victor dry cat food. The change has been nothing short of amazing. They are now a healthy weight with glossy hair and clear eyes. There's still the issue with homeless cats, but I think my neighbor is going to spay and release, but at least I can do what I can do by feeding them good quality food. The cheap 'corn as a main ingredient' cat foods are just horrible for cats. So, I do think the Victor is a 5-star food because it's very healthy. Even though my 2 pet cats didn't relish it, their probably just overly picky and not representative of most cats. I'd definitely recommend trying, if your cats will eat and like this, it will help to make them healthy or keep them that way.",6

That is not the case, grain is only bad for dogs with allergy's to grains. Which is rare. My 5 year old German Shepard has been eating this food for 4 years. He has never had an issue and surprisingly has not tired (knock on wood) from this. He loves it, and it gives him the nutrients he needs to stay active and VERY energetic. I can tell you from experience, whether we go for a hike, a run, a bike ride, or just stay at home. He always has the energy to keep moving. And that's partially thanks to this food. Plus Victors is a good brand, I know a lot of people who use this food and say the same things. And a lot of dog breeders as well. I have also heard the fine folks at Victors love dogs. They seem to from the quality of their food.",2

Her health has been great for the past eight years but recently I have been getting quite worried about it being manufactured by Diamond foods who has a somewhat lack luster record for recalls. We just added a German Shepherd puppy to our pack and I set out to find a food that was high quality, reasonably priced and all life stages food so that both my girls could eat it. Victor fits that bill. I gathered a list of potential suitors and then researched for several nights finally settling on Victor as it is rated as a high quality 5 star food on several of the pet food review websites, is highly praised on several forums and Victor has never had a recall that I could find. At the time of this review I have now had them on Victor Grain Free for about 4 months. A single 30lb bag will feed both my pups, a 7 month old German Shepherd and an adult Labrador for 1 month. Both my pups have shiny soft coats and unlike the last food they only have occasional gas and never have any stool problems. I rotate between the Active dog and puppy regular and the one with glucosamine since my girls also get a daily liquid glucosamine supplement. The girls love the food and go CRAZY for it. I do add a bit of warm water to the kibble which probably gives it more aroma. Lastly I also appreciate the small kibble size since my dogs eat very quickly. Victor is a winner for me. If your searching for a high quality food I would highly recommend this brand. I am certainly glad that my research into finding a better food led me in this direction.

Pearson,5.0,"March 4, 2019",Great for our German Shepherd puppy!,"We have a 4 1/2 month old Czech German Shepherd, and we switched her to Victor Active on January 18th. She came home from the breeder on a raw food diet that was supplemented with Taste of the Wild High Prairie Puppy. We slowly transitioned her off the raw food. Since we got her, her skin was very dry, and as we transitioned her off of raw food and completely onto the kibble, her coat became more and more dull, and her skin even more dry. We made the decision to try Victor Grain-Free Active Puppy and Beef kibble. We began to transition her on January 17th, and within about 10 days, her skin was beginning to get better, and her coat began to shine about 2 weeks after introducing it. She has been on it now for 6 1/2 weeks and no longer has any dandruff at all. Her entire coat is thick and shiny, and even strangers remark on it. She has also maintained steady growth, is very fit and has gained muscle tone, and she LOVES meal time! Picture 1 (sunrise): 2/3/18, 17 days after beginning Victor her coat is really beginning to shine and her dandruff is gone. Picture 2 (at the vet): 1/23/18, 6 days after beginning Victor. She was still getting the old kibble mixed in as we transitioned her over about a week. Her coat was very dull, and she still had a lot of dandruff, to the point that the vet was concerned. Picture 3 (under couch): 1/8/18, prior to starting Victor. I chose this picture because you can see quite a bit of dandruff if you look closely.",27

I didn't know it was because of the dog food that I fed him, again, I am a new pet owner. I talked to my friends who have dogs, and that's when I started searching for another type of dog food. I feel horrible that I fed him the crap that I bought from Petsmart for the entire 2 weeks without even considering to switch, because I thought the price tells everything! but I am totally WRONG!!! It has 1.5/5 stars on the complain report that I found online! So I did a lot of research on dog food, and because of my first experience, I am even more concerned this time. I trusted the reviews on amazon and other places, bought this red bag of Victor, my little guy is sooo much happier since day 1 I fed him this, he's now energetic (too energetic that I sometimes can't stand) and no more diarrhea!! His poop is well shaped and do not have the heavy smell like he had for the last 2 weeks. Victor earned the 5 stars!!! A small trick for dogs that have diarrhea. Mix rice with hard boil chicken breast and feed it for 2 days, the rice will do the magic, I found this online from a professional website, and it worked!! I hope it helps :).",18

She was refusing kibbles for the most part, and we tried a couple types. After reading scores of reviews and dog food write-ups, I was torn between Taste of the Wild and this Victor brand. I had friends recommending ToTW, but I was so leery about it being a Blue Diamond product that I wound up getting Victor instead. First thing I noticed was the kibbles were larger than I expected, especially for a ""puppy"" formula. They're more than twice the size of the Whole Hearted Grain Free she came home on. Still, as long as we moisten it first, she's perfectly happy to gobble this up (and it spoons into her Kong with no problem). Thank heavens....she loved it! She will eat the kibble by itself, but normally, we do reduce the kibble and measure in a bit of ground beef, sweet potato, or an egg. She was a skinny little thing at the shelter, but a few weeks later she's already filling out nicely. Her coat is shiny and healthy, and her stool is well formed with no diarrhea issues. (Well, ONCE, because my husband didn't know about switching dog food gradually and poured her a full serving of this the day after we got it.) I feel quite pleased that we went with this brand.",16

Fast forward 2 weeks later both of my dogs have now UNCONTROLLABLE and EXTREMELY LIQUID diarrhea. And it's black because Victor's food is very black. Be aware, diarrhea can occur at any given time. My poor dogs were taken out 3 times but still in the middle of the afternoon they will be walking in my living room and a jet of black liquid stool would come out of them, followed by a couple of hours of me cleaning.

About 3 weeks into the full switch I noticed his eyes were no longer weepy and my floor wasn’t covered in dog hair. He itches less and the shedding has been cut in half. Also he has more energy than we know what to do with! He gobbles it up like it’s the best food he’s ever had.

She loves food and inhaled it as she does. She was very sick throwing up afterwards. I googled the second ingredient, Blood Meal Conventially Dried on petpoisonhelpline.com, and this is what I learned. ...Blood meal is dried, ground, and flash-frozen blood and contains 12% nitrogen. While it's a great organic fertilizer, if ingested, it can cause vomiting, diarrhea, and severe pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas). Some types of blood meal are also fortified with iron, resulting in iron toxicity... The next morning I gave her Victor's again and she wouldn't go near it. So I exchange Victors for another dog food and she inhaled it and has been fine. For certain it was Victors dog food that caused her to be ill. I will hopefully be able to return to Amazon otherwise I will trash it.",5

But I wish they had a dedicated puppy formula. My active teenager GSD loved this but my GSD new pup, not so much. I have tried a few different kibbles with my pup. But that could be to a lot of factors including fat content and who knows what other manufacturers add to their food to enhance the taste. Frankly, the junk kibbles that my pup likes the most, I feed her in limited quantities. So I will continue to use Victor.

Unable to keep anything down, going to the bathroom more than usual, diarrhea, etc. She loved eating it as usual, but it was the aftermath that was like I have never experience with any food. It also didn't help that the color of the food is so dark because it was like a sharpie on any ground and really difficult to clean when she had accidents. I stopped feeding her after a week of the same, and bought her completely different food from a different brand and that automatically fixed her. She went straight to feeling healthy and normal activities. Stool was normal. I threw the remaining Victor food (the entire bag) and wasted my money due to this.

I freaked out thinking it was from his flea/tick- which it wasn't. We were in the middle of the box which we got from the vet. No new shampoo, no new environmental factors, no new cleaning products. The only new thing was the bag of food that I got from Amazon instead of from the retailer I usually get it from. I went ahead and bought a bag from my usual spot, and started feeding that to my dog. The rash started going away (after a solid 10 days of staying exactly the same while he was still being fed from the Amazon bag). I took my gardening PH tester, and tested both foods against each other, and they were completely different. The PH of the food I got from my usual place was balanced, whereas the PH of the Amazon bag was extremely basic. Which leads me to assume that they used toxic cleaners near/on food in the warehouses. I have raised this concern to two different customer service agents, and expressed it as the reason for my return. I have yet to hear back.",11

We have used some of the more expensive brands, but none were of a higher quality, and we are also saving $ being able to replace the separate joint health supplement with the daily feed. We would definitely recommend this product.",9

DO NOT CONSIDER THIS SOURCE OF FOOD! All 5 of my cats eat Victor brand food that I buy locally. With the summer being a busy time, I wanted to get a home delivery started. Our local feed store closes at 5 pm and we are often racing against time to reach the store before closing. I switched to Victor about 9 months ago because we had at least one cat that couldn't hold down the food the others could. Although the brand is not cheap, it does cost less than our previous Science Diet brand. Victor has been what I do call ""Our saving grace"" with indoor cats. They are all happy without any upset tummies. I will use either Mers Feline or the High Pro Plus. Each new bag is mixed with the last 2 pounds of the previous bag. When this arrived, I mixed it accordingly to my process. Within a few hours of my cats eating this food, they were all getting sick. I called our vet and he said to give it a few days and monitor each cat to see whom it is affecting. For the past two days, I have witnessed all 5 of my cats sick from this food. I am not sure if it is the way Amazon is storing it or if this is a bad batch. Until this experience, I have now realized how tough it is to contact anyone at Victor. This leaves a bad impression on me. I will go back to my local feed store and purchase a new bag of cat food. Lesson learned from Amazon .... do not buy cat food online!",One

He's 12 yrs old and has a history of allergies that almost always lead to painful ear infections. He's always been a VERY finicky eater to and I would have to change his food almost monthly. After getting exasperated with all the vet bills and the poor guy's continued suffering, I decide to try this stuff because it just has fish meat in it. It's been amazing...he loves it and the vet has been absolutely amazed at how healthy he is, including a beautiful soft coat without all the itchy raw spots he's had most of his life. I will admit I have added some supplements to the food out of the bag. To a cup of kibble I add a squirt of salmon oil, a few drops of Vitamin E oil, a TBSP of glucosamine powder, a teaspoon of coconut oil, a quarter can of tuna fish, and a tablespoon of unflavored Greek yogurt. I know that sounds like a lot, but its all in one place on the counter and I can fix it in less than 2 minutes. And I've saved so much in vet bills, and most important of all, he doesn't tire of the food and looks better than he has in this entire life. Hell of a lot of energy for a 12 year old, too! After buying the first couple of bags here, I found it at a much more reasonable price AND free shipping from an online competitor. A Google search will quickly identify the source.",2

I asked the GS's breeder what food she recommended and she said Victor, without hesitation. I read the many reviews on the product, and was happy to see that so many people have had success across breeds. So, I made the jump about three months ago. Slowly introduced the Victor formula into their diet per the manufacturer's instructions. First, let me say, my pups LOVE this food. They don't overeat it, but they don't leave any left behind in their bowls, or their whiskers. Second, their stools are a good consistency and healthy looking. Third, I have seen a marked improvement in their coats. They both have shinier and softer hair (which is saying something for a schnauzer breed). I just wish Amazon would make Victor a subscribe and save product, like they recently did with Blue Buffalo.",18

You may be wondering, ""why aren't you feeding him puppy food?"" Well because contrary to popular belief, most puppy foods are not good for large or giant breeds...yes, even the ones that say ""large breed puppy food"". These puppy foods are usually TOO rich in protein and calcium. They also often have the wrong calcium/phosphorus ratio. Large or giant breeds should grow steadily, not rapidly. If a large/giant breed puppy grows too fast, he/she will likely end up with major joint problems...including the dreaded hip dysplasia. I actually mix the Victor with Avoderm grain-free salmon and sweet potato 50/50 and this gives me the correct amounts of each nutrient. In general, you want protein to be in the mid to high 20% range anything higher than 30% and you're risking it...calcium between 1.0-1.3...calcium/phosphorus ratio at just about 1/1. In the mid 90s I had a big Rottie(Thor) that I wanted to grow fast and learned all of this the hard way. Although both his parents were rated ""excellent"" by OFA, Thor turned out to be severely dysplastic. It broke my heart, as he got older, to constantly see him try to pull himself up off the floor with minimal use of his hind quarters. To realize that it was more than likely my fault was devastating. I hope this can at least help someone who doesn't know make an informed decision on the right food for your large/giant pup. I was one of those that didn't know and I really wish I had come across this information from Thor's puppyhood...by the way, he was also from a Champion bloodline and considered a ""show quality"" puppy. However, he also turned out to be greatly undershot, which is a disqualifying fault for the breed standard. Again, both parents...scissor bites. This was also likely the result of too much calcium in the diet. Your puppy can have all the genes of a champion dog, but if malnourished, it won't matter. Please do your research to ensure the health of your pup. I am a huge dog lover and I really hope I helped keep someone from making the same mistake I made with this review. Good luck and God Bless your dog! In addition to the correct nutritional value, most puppy foods are not grain-free. A lot of large/giant breeds have some type of allergy toward grains.",17

This is considered a “premium” dog food, but the manufacturer has now upped the filler and lowered the % of the primary ingredients... yet we are still paying a premium price 2) This formula now includes chicken fat as a primary ingredient (for those of you who may have a dog with a poultry allergy - like we do) 3) The customer service team either lacks knowledge or is simply careless. I called customer service a couple months ago when I saw the package change online (before the updated ingredients were available online) to confirm any ingredient/ formula changes, and the rep ASSURED me that while there were a few minor formula changes, there was NO poultry (chicken, chicken meal, eggs, etc). Now that the new formula is available online, chicken fat is clearly listed as the 3rd ingredient. How could she miss that? 4) How can a premium dog food manufacturer who allegedly understands food allergies (since they have many grain free options) no longer offer a product that is BOTH grain &amp; poultry free? How do they not understand that many of us who choose the grain free seafood option are trying to avoid both grains and poultry due to our pet’s food allergies? 5)Those of us who buy this brand and formula have chosen to pay a premium price for exceptional ingredients and local sourcing. After several failed attempts to find a food that worked for my dog’s severe allergies, we found and have very happily purchased this formula for the past 4 years. When the best ingredients are moved lower on the list (now in smaller proportions) - and other fillers like menhaden fish meal, chicken fat, garbanzo beans, and blood meal are added and/or primary, it’s no longer “premium” and not what we were formerly paying for. When they decided to cut costs on premium quality primary ingredients to achieve cost savings and higher profits, they weren’t willing to rebrand the product accordingly... I mean, would YOU buy this product if instead of calling it “Salmon &amp; Sweet Potato”, they called it by its REAL name —- “Menhaden Fish Meal and Chicken Fat”?! We have switched to Merrick and am very happy with our new brand.",32

I let myself be bullied into trying a couple of things at Petco before getting bawled out by my vet for succumbing to all the hype about certain foods--but mainly I just wanted her to EAT. My breeder suggested BillJac, which she sort of liked, but it is very dry and you can't wet it or it turns to pure mush. Then another German Shorthair showdog owner suggested I try Victor. It has the reputation for being a good food. It IS pricey, but it isn't available to me locally. Now I give her two cups of Victor beside two cups of Billjac in her bowl each evening. She alternates on which side of the bowl she goes after. Usually all four cups are gone by mid-day the next day, at which point we load her up again. She is MAINTAINING her weight--not gaining, but I find I have to really coddle her to get weight on her. Food just doesn't motivate her--unless it's blocks of cheese.",12

When I opened it yesterday I was a little surprised to find that it expires next week. That is an issue for me because I have small dogs that eat small quantities. I have never looked at the dates before on the other bags and now wonder if they were about to expire as well. I ordered a new bag to see if it is fresher. I am not sure if I will continue to feed this food if that is the case. I do think it is a good food and made in the USA but if I go to the trouble to seek out a good food with high quality ingredients I would prefer it to be fresher. I would suggest you check the dates on the back of the bag to insure freshness especially if you keep an extra bag on hand or feed smaller dogs and don't use as much otherwise I consider the food to be a good high quality food.,5

Also, price went up. Another reviewer noted it is not free of chicken anymore if this should be an issue for your dog as the 3rd ingredient is now chicken fat preserved with ""mixed something something"".

I've already ordered some more Victor, just another type. I guess every dog has different tastes, but my German Shepherd and Australian Shepherd just aren't into this ""Ocean Blend"".",5

Victor dog food is a very good food. Obviously any fool will know that dogs may not like it or it may not agree with your dog-hey, that's life. That being said, my pack which includes two who can't eat grains and have exceptionally touchy stomachs, two elderly(one old dude is a touchy dog), a toy and a large breed puppy all eat the same food and do great. We rotate diets between four high quality brands to reduce overexposure to the same ingredients, mostly the vitamins and minerals added. We happen to also really like the smaller, firmer poops we go around and scoop every morning. Our dogs are thriving on this and the other foods with their rotational diet. Victor is very dependable in nutritional quality and it's high manufacturing quality so not worried about the next huge brands' food recall. It works great with all our dogs. I've kind of gone over why we feed Victor and the fact it works with them, but if your dog is doing awesome on the foods he's on, why fix what isn't broken? If you're looking into a move up in diet, this is a great food, but please, for the love of Pete! make a GRADUAL change. If your dog is sensitive or older this change could be up to three or four times longer. I mean, imaging your stomach going from a diet of plain toast for years over to one full of fruits and veg quickly-even over two weeks. Um, where's the toilet, right? Think about what your dog has been eating for a sec and a gradual change would probably be a good idea, no? This goes for any dog food. I believe a too quick switch (and that time varies from dog to dog) is often the culprit for why dogs get sick after switching from one food to another in so many of the bad reviews. I've read it in so many how a food is terrible and the cause of all that ails the dog and yours is next! Eek! Uh, it's probably that dog, not all dogs, and not bad food. It's just not the right one for that dog but probably fine for 99% of dogs. Obviously, if your dog, even with a slow switch, continues to get the poops, then whatever the new food is it's probably not a good match for your dog's system; they are unique just like people.",22

Her health has been great for the past eight years but recently I have been getting quite worried about it being manufactured by Diamond foods who has a somewhat lack luster record for recalls. We just added a German Shepherd puppy to our pack and I set out to find a food that was high quality, reasonably priced and all life stages food so that both my girls could eat it. Victor fits that bill. I gathered a list of potential suitors and then researched for several nights finally settling on Victor as it is rated as a high quality 5 star food on several of the pet food review websites, is highly praised on several forums and Victor has never had a recall that I could find. At the time of this review I have now had them on Victor Grain Free for about 4 months. A single 30lb bag will feed both my pups, a 7 month old German Shepherd and an adult Labrador for 1 month. Both my pups have shiny soft coats and unlike the last food they only have occasional gas and never have any stool problems. I rotate between the Active dog and puppy regular and this one with glucosamine already added since my girls also get a daily liquid glucosamine supplement. The girls love the food and go CRAZY for it. I do add a bit of warm water to the kibble which probably gives it more aroma. Lastly I also appreciate the small kibble size since my dogs eat very quickly. Victor is a winner for me. If your searching for a high quality food I would highly recommend this brand. I am certainly glad that my research into finding a better food led me in this direction. If this review was helpful please click yes below. Thank you.",140

My dog has severe allergies. Since switching to this grain free variety, his skin is so much better and his coat is so shiny and smooth. I have two German Shepherd's and you could only imagine how often we have to poop scoop the yard. At first, even after slowly integrating this food with their old food, their stools were a little bit runny. It has been a few months now and they are 100% on Victor Ultra Pro 42 with no problems. It's hard to explain, but even their poop is easier to pick up. The extra high protein makes turd rocks. No more smeary messes outside. It's awesome! My puppy, at 9 months, and 55 lbs, has been on this food for about 3 months. She has finally filled out and doesn't look starved. She get more nutrients on this food than any other ""puppy formula"" I have compared it to. My old man usually fluctuates between 85 and 98 lbs depending on the time of the year. Right now it is winter time in Sunny California and he is up to 107 lbs! They run 2 miles a day, so they are lean mean protective machines on Victor. 6 stars!",10

Note: I noticed the oils start smelling a bit rancid as we work toward the bottom of the bag, so I've been trying to keep it closed more tightly so it doesn't spoil as quickly.",11

I have Bloodhounds, a GS Pointer x Lab mix, an adventure Pug, and my Moms Caviller King Charles Spaniel all on this same food and each are thriving. The working dogs and those who burn through more calories get to eat a little more, the more lazy bones dogs get to eat a little less, and everyone is VERY excited for dinner, and quite full and happy afterword. I have seen the quantity of poop that I have to scoop decrease favorably while watching the coat quality and body composition improve as well. It is a win win situation. The one last thing we do here in the house of bloodhound is to serve all food with nice hot from the tap water, which makes dinner have a nice sauce if you let it sit a minute before handing it out. As well as enhancing the flavors, adding water also reduces air in the stomach and therefore reduces the likelihood of a twisted stomach, or bloat, that hounds are “statistically prone to.” So bottom line, I would yes 10/10 would recommend, even for picky eaters.",6

I'd never heard of it before (but have since!). Tried it, transitioned our two pups over, and they loved it. After a few months, we could noticeably tell a difference in their coats (they SHINE) and our boy pup naturally lost weight. So while it didn't help with his gas, his body liked it a lot otherwise and he looks great - I didn't realize he was as chubby as he was until he lost it just by switching dog food (same amount).

One thing I like about this is that the pieces are so small that even my smallest dogs can eat it easily. Unfortunately, all of these 5 Star foods are expensive but I feel that I have to have a pretty much grain free beef food that contains not only Glucosamine and Chondroitin but also probiotics. I have to keep my Lab on a very limited amount because he gains weight easily and will have trouble with his hips if he is too heavy. The BUT in the title above is for the fact that this food does indeed cause GAS in my Lab. I'll have to just feed it to my little dogs and go back to the Merrick for my Lab. I guess it is the sweet potato in the formula causing the gas. Who knows....",2

At first I thought they were eating too fast or being too active immediately after eating - but then I realized it was the food. They also both started getting tear stains and dirtier looking ears which made me suspicious. Originally, they loved it and were very excited about this food. Their energy levels were up. I was happy. After researching and speaking with a knowledgable person at a local pet spa/retail/kennel - she told me that Victor had recently started adding by-products to their food. When we asked the time frame, she said within the last 6 months. So it seems that when they changed the food to be cheaper to produce, my dogs knew it. I've now switched to Acana grain-free which is working very well so far. Also to note, neither of my dogs has stinky breath since switching from Pro 42.

She is the most wonderful doggo ever BUT she has a yeast problem! She is a yeast making machine and most food make it worse. She gets constant ear infections and then it spreads. That effects her entire body. Her anal glands get packed up, her skin starts getting it hit and flakey, her ears and feet go bald and the skin thickens. Her feet itch so she licks and chews at them which makes her nails brittle they get sharp as glass. I have many bad scratches to prove that one. The yeasty stink is like a rotten corn chip and it gets all over my house to the point where I’m smelling it constantly. So many nights she’s woken up in pain and starts shaking her head, pawing at her ears and crying. The vet has tried lots of things but nothing has helped for the long term. I have been trying to find a good quality grain free kibble that isn’t crazy expensive but she either doesn’t like the taste or it doesn’t help. I add Native omega 3 salmon oil and probiotic powder to her food and in a few weeks time I have seen the biggest difference in her coat and skin. She isn’t licking and chewing at her feet and bum and her coat has gone from feeling like this weird oily corse grossness to beautiful shiny and sleek. She sleeps better and poops better too! I swear her poo doesn’t even stink as bad plus it looks healthier if that makes sense. The red dye in cheaper dog foods in a common allergen and I have notice the color of her dodoo in the backyard isn’t red anymore. She loves the food and I am thrilled that she’s feeling better. My other pup who is not a yeasty beast loves it too and has also gotten very shiny and sleek. I highly recommend!",

I have decided to exchange their diet from victor yellow bag for $35 to victor lamb for $71 because I heard that lamb is better for dogs vs beef and pork and chicken... worst mistake ever. My spoiled french bulldogs have refused to eat the mix of the old yellow victor and the new lamb, well I said maybe they just want the lamb so I took the mix out of their plate and put just plain lamb, I talk to them to eat it that is good, and yummy, the looked at me like b***tch no. so i left the room came back and nothing the whole day they have not eaten a bite, so i went back to their room at diner and nothing either. Well, I hear my dog chewing something.. that Mother Flower was eating their poop and didn't touch the Expensive lamb kibbles. What a disappointment! Say no more... next time try the small bag before buy it, or just don't try new food at the end dogs can eat the same thing for 30 years, they are different from us. I still believe in victor I have no complain and I recommend 100% cause is what they love, and I have tried lots of brands before and the price is not an issue when it comes to my french bulldog diet.

They are very happy and actually seem to be eating less food also then the other dog food. The bloating and excess weight the dogs were carrying is dropping off also.

I had a bit left of the first order (Sept 2019 expiration dated bag) and held it in one hand and held the new (Aug. 2019 expiration dated bag) kibble in the other hand, she ate the Sept. 2019 exp. dated bag kibble happily, sniffed the Aug. 2019 exp. dated one and walked away. Amazon replaced it but the replacement had the same Aug. 2019 exp. and the same batch #, she will not touch it. Photos shows the 2 ""bad bag"" showing what I believe to be the batch # with the exp. date. Amazon sending another replacement, hoping I will not get this same batch again. I really hope it's just an ingredient ratio thing and the combo is just unappetizing to her, and not that there's anything harmful in it? 3 stars because she did love the first order...just hoping for better quality check/consistency in the future.

They are good eaters. They ate the food, but the food caused constipation. I had to mix Miralax in their meals so they could do number 2 easier. The kibbles have a STRONG smell and are very dark; black in color. OMG when the dogs go to the bathroom, black stools and dreadful smelly. That food gave my male dog allergies that his rectum was inflamed 2 centimeters deep. He had two polyps that needed cauterization, plus I had to pay for the biopsy. Switched them to Kirkland brand made by Costco. Lamb, brown rice, and vegetable formula. THEY LOVE IT. More shinny coat, no foul stools, and no more rectum problems.

I got a good deal on this food with a coupon, so I looked it up and saw it was well rated nutritionally. Now she is obsessed with it, and asks to be fed all the time. I’m always telling her it’s not time to eat yet, and she looks at me like I’m depriving her.

It was an easy multi-day transition, no stomach upset and she really likes the taste. Her feces are solid and smaller. This food has more calories per cup than the previous kibble, and suggests a total of 3/4 cups more per day than my previous kibble. I upped each feeding a little, but not to 3-3/4 cups a day. I change it up once a day adding goats milk, or cottage cheese, unrefined coconut oil... Her fur is soft and shiny, her energy is the same and she's maintained her waist.

My schnauzer really likes the sweet potato ingredient's taste in the Victor brand. I am very careful to check ""use by"" freshness dates whenever I purchase from a feed store or pet shop, as I have had dog food turn rancid before the freshness dates printed on the bags, especially if a skid of food was left in the hot sun upon its delivery in AZ. This time I ordered the bag of Victor from Amazon. The bag showed up fine. The food smelled OK through the breather holes on the bag's sides, but even rancid food can smell ok, at least for awhile. The strange thing is that this bag had no ""use by"" date imprinted on the top rear of the bag!!! It is a sealed Victor bag of Grain Free with Chicken Meal and Sweet Potato, but the manufacturer's agent at the customer service number on the bag, said not to use it and ask Amazon for a replacement. This I did this morning. I hope the replacement has an imprinted date on the bag's top, as I was informed that dog food from Amazon CANNOT BE RETURNED. I'll be asking for a refund if the 2nd bag is similarly ""unmarked"". I hope this doesn't happen, because I won't chance having a sick dog.",

I was feeding her a high quality imported brand of dog food but I made the switch to Victor because she was ready for an adult formula and I wanted to buy a brand that is made in America. So far so good, I did notice some irregular bowel movements during the first several days of the switch but that has gone away and overall she is more regular now than she was before she was eating Victor. These kibbles are also harder than the kibbles she was eating but she doesn't seem to mind crunching on them. I think the harder kibbles are better for her jaw muscles and preventing plaque buildup on her teeth anyway. This dog food is a little expensive but as I mentioned before her coat seems to be growing in thicker and I imagine that means her joints are probably healthier too.

I kept trying the richest kibble I could find for her, and a friend said that her working border collies do great on this food, so I tracked down a dealer and tried it. Even doing a very slow (10 day) change caused soft (but formed) stool, but within a week of being completely switched over to the Victor her stools are very small, because of the high digestibility of the food, and very firm, which makes them very easy to pick up. There is also much less odor than there has been with other high quality, grain free dog foods. I love the fact that my dog's coat is sleek and glossy, her itchy skin has cleared up, and best of all, she's finally beautifully filled out and muscled. She no longer looks like a dairy cow! The food is expensive, but I feel it gives very good value, and I think it's worth the price. It lasts much longer than 30 pounds of any other food I've fed my dog, so to avoid the food going rancid I keep the food in a Rubbermaid latch-top tote to keep it fresher, and I don't ever get the bottom-of-the-bag funky odor.",2

No regrets at all,"2023 update... I got a Husky puppy and went back to the Ultra Pro. I was using Hero Canine for the last few years because it had the glucosamine but it's not rated for puppy's. I have noticed that my dogs eat far less on the grain free which makes the bags last longer and they look so much better. I might go back to the Hero once he gets bigger because it comes in a bigger bag and is cheaper. They have many variations and all have no corn, soy, or gluten.

We had him on Science diet for sensitive stomach for years and was doing better on that food but still got gassy and loose stools on occasion. He then had an episode of GI bleeding and vet suggested to try minimal ingredient dog food to see if we can find out what food he was sensitive to. I initially gave him Blue Buffalo basics but when needed to reorder it was out of stock (or for an elevated price). Since I was giving him the lamb and potato, I went looking for grain free lamb and potato and this came up so went ahead and ordered since similar ingredients. When I opened bag it actually smelled good and my dog ate it just fine. Now, not only are his GI symptoms so much better, his poop doesn't smell nearly as bad as they used to ;)!

All dry foods destroy nutrients while producing it. It is also a single business that packs only their own foods and ingredients are bought locally in USA. No I do not work for company!

Good ingredients, decent oval size kibbles for medium and large dogs, the size of a dime width wise and about 2.5 stacked dimes height wise. My dog lovessss this kibble, so much so he picks it out of his previous 'liked' kibbles (best breed german shepherd) and leaves the old kibbles sitting till next meal when i mixed it with some canned food. This food does cost more than his $56 per 28lb bag we currently are using but, we are now switching over to this food anyways since he loves it so much and i don't have to worry about him not eating it in one sitting when he only gets this food. We still have 1.5 28lbs bags of the best breed (also a great food and more affordable if can't afford cost of this bully one) so going to mix half and half with the 3 15lbs bags i' ordered from company after trying this bag here, it is cheaper per bag to do buy on their site although delivery cost after those 3 bags is beyond ridiculous on their site, even on autoship.. overall good food with lower fat, apparently great flavor to our GSD (but not to our mix lab but, she doesn't count cause she is beyond overly picky with kibbles). recommend if can afford its higher price, it is worth it in the end, since a good protein source, we will offset the higher cost by simply ridden of one can of his beyond wild can food per day!!",2

Provides a lot of protein and vitamins for a growing strong dog. Definitely recommend. Before using you have to SLOWLY transition your dog's over to this food. You cannot just instantly start giving them just this. You need to slowly mix it into their previous food and each day for a week slowly add more and more of this. If you give them just this instantly it makes them sick because of the high protein content and they aren't used to eating it. There are directions right on the bag that show you the amounts to add each day to transition them over. But my dogs love it now and definitely seems to give them more energy and give more muscle definition for sure. I add raw chicken to this too and they tear it up.,

You could get a comparably great food for much cheaper.

Thought we had a real homerun with this food. But he soon became his normal picky self and turned his nose up at the food if there was nothing else in his bowl with the food.

Our, now 4 month old, chocolate lab has a Mega-E and has struggled with weight since we got him at 10 weeks old; we were not aware of his condition at that time and the seller denied any medical issues - we just assumed he was the runt! Anywho - this food actually SMELLS much BETTER than his other dog food which is a pricey, all natural food as well (Merrick), and he seems to love the taste! Bully Max also softens so much faster and easier when soaked in a bit of water compared to other brands which is such a relief because it's less time mashing or grinding kibble for me! So far he has been able to gain weight, although very slowly since he continues to regurgitate despite now having a Bailey Chair. We did the recommended new food introduction listed on the side of the bag and he's had no change in his regurgitation (which is expected and normal) but he hasn't experienced any adverse reactions that dogs sometimes do with new foods. We recommend this to anyone with a puppy or adult canine needing to access more calories for weight gain",3

In the few weeks it too to get a handle on things, he went from 45lbs down to 33lbs. He also needed surgery on his airway for an unrelated issue and we really wanted him to gain some weight so he’d be stronger going into surgery. This was the highest calorie dry food I could find so it’s what we tried and I’m so glad. 1.) he loved it 2.) the small kibble size made it easier for him to eat 3.) it worked! We mixed 1 cup of this with half a can of high calorie wet canned food topper per meal and fed him 2-3 meals a day. In 2 weeks he was up to 40lbs and had his muscle tone and strength back. The surgery was a success, he got up to his normal weight shortly after, and we dropped his serving size down to maintain his weight. I think I’ll start all future dogs on this food from the start.",3

We were worried that he was sick or that something had gone haywire in his gut, the vet suggested switching food and the stinky farts from hell have since gone away. Our vet suggested using this as a mix in rather than daily food if we want to continue using it but I'd rather not live in a fart palace so we have since stopped.

I just rescued a 6 month old Frenchie and her stools were ranging from loose to absolute liquid! Poor thing was constantly looking for grass to eat so it could sooth her belly… She was previously switched to diamond puppy from a different food not sure what it was but i can say that diamond puppy wasn’t good for her at all! I looked at the ingredients and that food has a lot of what Frenchies are allergic to that being said it’s day #2 on Bully Mix and my pups stools are more firm, finally 🙏🏻 and she gobbled it all up so I’m guessing it’s a 10/10 on flavor as well. I did have her on a 3day cleanse before i gave it to her so her digestive tract could have a break. I gave her plenty of fresh water and light snacks like pealed apples etc… Bully Mix looks to have high quality ingredients and the nutrients Frenchies need. I’m hoping it will only get better for my girl here on out. It’s a bit pricey but ending at the vet because of poor quality food causing health issues will cost way more! Once she’s on adult food I’ll be switching my Rottie to this so they can both eat the same quality food.",

And I just ordered two bags of it because the price dropped to $34 for a bag instead of $45. When I ordered I wondered if maybe they were trying to get rid of some expired or old dog food. So now that my dogs all got diarrhea from it I am thinking that it's either old or expired. Or close to expiring. This has never happened with Victor select and even this Victor classic. Now I'm afraid to switch them to Victor classic in the future. I have a second bag that's still waiting to be used from that $34 deal. I just reordered a bag of Victor select and will get them back on that so I can get the stools hard again. Loose stools is a big problem for one of my dogs not being able to express her anal glands and she smells like fish.,15

I don't know why but every time he eats there's always one ""last bite"" left. We subscribe dog food through amazon and rotate between brands (mostly Blue and Wellness, but also Taste of the Wild, and Whole Earth Farms) switching up flavors as well but he never quite finish his food. After his annual checkup we're asked to give him regular non grain-free food (you can read grain-free and heart disease in dogs online). It is surprisingly difficult to find premium food with grain! My dog also has allergy to something so I try to limit ingredients. Last bag was CANIDAE PURE Real Salmon and was good for his skin, but it was grain free. I decided to try Victor for the first time and so happy that he finishes his food! Fingers cross. It's been a week so far and we are all very happy.",2

I have been feeding him this food for about 3 weeks now and he comes running when I fill his food dish. His previous food was rated a 4.5 and noted as one of the best dry foods you can feed your dog. That same accredited website gave this food a 5 star rating due to the benefits that it provides any dog. This will be his food for the rest of his life. We have been dealing with minor skin and intermittent hind leg issues. It seems to me that this food has helped relieve his skin issues and his coat is shinier and softer. He used to limp all day long after walks or exercise and the Vet could not find any reason for this even after scans and x-rays. While I still seek a permanent solution to his limping issue I have noticed that he has a much quicker recovery time now. it seems that this food is just what my dog needed and I'm sure it will be the same for others. I also contacted Bully Max to let them know I need them to start making 30lb bags. They said that they have received this request a lot and that they are looking into it.,2

I haven't actually eaten any of this, so I can't really chime in as per taste, but considering Stitch does not like lettuce, but will eat this food has to speak for something.

Recent FDA warnings regarding dog food ingredients and potential related health risks have many pet parents are scouring research and reading up on exactly what is in their pets food. While Bully Max received at 5 star rating from petfoodadvisor.com, Bully Max does not have (that I could find) AAFCO (Association of American Feed Control Officals) compliance information listed on their website or on their feed bags. As such, it was unclear to me if Max Bully meets AFFCO set standards for my large breed puppy. Additionally, Bully Max’s website is limited and provides no information about where their ingredients (including additives like vitamins) are sourced (USA? China? Brazil? etc.) or their processing facility. This is important as there have been historical industry issues with cheap ingredients sourced from China. Bully Max seems like a smaller company that is doing its best to provide a quality product, which is very commendable. I would just encourage Bully Max to be more aware of their market and what consumers are looking for, to update the AAFCO information on their bags, and to expand their website (which right now feels more like an extended advertisement vs informational). If customers are willing to pay the cost then Bully Max owes it to them to be as informative and transparent as possible. There is no such thing a a perfect dry dog food but we all hope to feed our pets the best we can. For now, after extensive research, I’ve chosen to skip Bully Max and instead have opted for Annamaet Ultra. Other good options are Victor Purpose Nutra Pro or Diamond Naturals Extreme Athlete which has 470 kcal/cup. All of which also have 5 star ratings from petfoodadvisor.com.",336

We feed her 3 times a day. It's been a month and she is only a few pounds shy of her healthy weight!

I guess I should start migrating her to a food that is readily available. 5/19/22 Update - My dog has refused to eat Bullymax after eating it since I got her. Suddenly she won't touch it unless mixec with a topper and even then she only eats part of it. At the cost of this food for a 40 pound I decided to feed her a raw meat diet. At least she has variety and slams the food down. She seems much healtheir since I strated feeding her a raw diet. Comes out to the same cost as buying this and dog seemshappir and her coat looks great. What did you all do to the food?,

Since I have a litter of mastiff puppies I went rotation feeding for them in case their new owners did not want to feed raw. I had them on the Nutra Pro from victor and they did fine and ate it happily. Since they are in rapid growth stage I wanted to lower the protein and calcium/phosphorus level a bit. So I rotated to the professional which in the past I've never had a dog refuse. The puppies refuse to eat it other than a nibble here and there. I've even tried it with the Nutra Pro mixed in and they will just pick the Nutar Pro kibble out and leave this behind. I understand they changed their formula but the meat content is still high and looks to be a good formula. Perhaps I just got a bad bag. I am giving 3 stars because not even the mother dog would touch it and she will eat anything. If you have large/ giant puppies I can enthusiastically recommend the Nutra Pro but not this one at this time.,4

I believe the bag was torn on the second because there seemed to be a tremendous amount of oil coming off the food, had soaked the bag from the inside, causing it to tear. It was not torn in transit. Given that, one star was removed but perhaps more should have been, for lack of quality control. Now in a dilemma of what to purchase next time for my dogs.",12

I usually place an Amazon order twice a month. Maybe I should just stock up because here I am going to place my order and this food is out of stock - delivery is listed at 5-6 weeks. So my alternative is to buy a different Victor food and keep fingers crossed I don't have any issues. If Wisconsin was on their ""free delivery"" state list I would be buying it direct from Victor and not having to worry about availability. The food is great but the availability and delivery I would give 2 stars.",2
