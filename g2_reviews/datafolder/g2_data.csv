They claim to care about their customers and want them never to feel taken advantage of, however when they decide to ""hold and review"" a small business' deposits for services already completed they are allowed to hold it for 270 days or make you return it to the vendor while charging you a 3.4%+.25 fee for doing the transaction at their discretion. On 12/16, we had three invoices paid by a customer and quick books decided since the amount was a large one they needed to hold if for review, I understand that banks will hold a large deposit for a couple of days to a week if it is a large amount until it clears, however this was not the case they asked for us to provide 6 months of bank statements, a contract signed by our customer, the customers billing information, signed invoices, and a questionnaire answered, just to get the deposit that the had already charged us 3 percent to hold in their account. We called many times and tried to chat with an expert also to be told over and over the same thing, we just wanted the transaction reversed so our customer could send us an ACH payment, but we were told they needed to review this further. Skip ahead 2 weeks we had agreed to just have funds deposited because we were told they couldn't reverse the transaction and agreed to pay the initial 3% fee if they would deposit, and they decide to tell us they are uncomfortable funding this transaction and they would not give a reason even though we have been doing business with them for over 2 years and our customer is completely legitimate. They said our only option was to refund the customers money through our merchant account and that it would cost us another 6800 dollars to do so, but they may waive that fee for us since they were making us return it, but it was not guaranteed. However they would not return the original 6000 dollar transaction fee that had to stay on our account???? So in essence, what they did was take an interest-free loan with our 200,00 dollars and hold it in their account for three weeks and charge us almost 6000 dollars to do so. 
 We followed their directions to return the funds and now that transaction is on hold for review in our account, our customer cannot pay us until they see that money in their account but we have completed these jobs over a month ago and who knows when we will get our money paid to us. We were told the case was being escalated to supervisors multiple times and we received no communication on this, we were promised email updates and never heard anything. We had to spend hours every day for weeks on the phone and online chat to try to get answers from these people and ended up no better than when we started, when we finally did get a hold of a supervisor, he said things like this happen all the time and their company is a joke that does not care about their customers and it is completely unfair, but they don't have the power to help with anything either.
