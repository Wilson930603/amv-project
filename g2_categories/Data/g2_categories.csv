These tools leverage machine learning to identify patterns and monitor user or machine behaviors, notifying stakeholders of abnormal activity, malicious behavior, or performance issues that arise from mistakes or improper operational actions.
Companies use UEBA technology to protect their sensitive information and business critical systems from both external and insider threats. These may be employees or partners that partake in nefarious activities such as stealing data, adjusting privileges, or violating company policies. UEBA solutions can also detect compromised accounts that may have resulted from weak passwords or phishing scams that provide network access to unapproved parties. UEBA can uncover a number of external threat types as well; most notably, brute force attacks and privilege escalation.
UEBA functions on a similar basis as risk-based authentication (RBA) software

As opposed to traditional network security systems, which provide a castle-and-moat system for granting access into a network, the zero trust model assumes every individual, both internal and external, is a potential threat until they are verified.
Companies have adopted the zero trust security model since decentralized business models and IT systems have made it significantly more complicated to ensure proper access controls are in place across multiple networks and physical locations. Zero trust networking solutions allow companies to continuously monitor network activity and user behavior to adapt authentication requirements on an individual basis. Verified individuals behaving abnormally or attempting to violate their permissions will be prompted to provide further authentication. Data is collected from access points, behaviors, and traffic logs to provide in-depth network security analytics capabilities.

SDP itself is an architecture designed to allow access on a need-to-know basis, meaning every device and user must be verified before accessing either the network as a whole or specific systems and applications within a network. Unlike traditional network access controllers that utilize a lock and key approach, SDP segments networks by application use and analyzes user access permissions at a granular level across the network. SDP administrators can also customize and automate highly specific network security policies while enforcing them continuously.
Companies adopt SDP solutions because traditional network protection ecosystems are insufficient. If a hacker or unauthorized user obtains access to a traditional network, it’s uncertain what they can access. SDP, on the other hand, analyzes each access request at the application level, compares it to the user’s privileges, then grants or denies access. This verification process occurs continuously, increasing visibility into user behaviors and privileges.
SDP solutions differ from virtual private networks (VPN)
because VPNs simply provide a barrier to network entry: an easy target for hackers. SDP, on the other hand, provides continuous authentication functionality and visibility into traffic and network activity. There is some overlap between zero-trust security
solutions and SDP products as some SDP solutions utilize the zero-trust approach to continuous verification, simply hiding services, applications, networks, and devices until requests are verified.

https://www.g2.com/categories/network-detection-and-response-ndr,Network Detection and Response (NDR) Software,"Network detection and response (NDR) software is used to document business network activity for security threats and alert relevant parties or automate threat remediation. These tools work by monitoring east-west traffic and comparing them to established baselines. When traffic behavior deviates from normal functionality, the solution will detect the issue and assist in forensic investigation. Many tools include or integrate with other solutions that automate incident response processes to minimize the threat’s impact.
These tools are used by security professionals and IT staff to observe network traffic and detect anomalies related to user behavior. Other, older technologies may offer one component of network threat detection or incident response, but NDR combines the functionality of numerous security solutions. These tools use artificial intelligence and machine learning to analyze user behavior as well as existing security data; security professionals can then use that data to develop streamlined discovery and response workflows.
Network traffic analysis (NTA)
is a similar emerging technology related to NDR. NTA is the core technology behind NDR; it refers to the analytical and monitoring capabilities used to develop baselines and response frameworks as NDR. But NTA solutions do not have the same level of response automation and end-user, behavioral anomaly detection used to trigger incident response. Endpoint detection and response (EDR)
has a similar name, but products within that category only detect issues at the device level while NDR provides visibility to threats across the entire network.

These tools isolate components of data centers and cloud workloads using network virtualization to deploy and protect them independently. This helps companies better visualize their assets and workloads to improve visibility, detection, and remediation time all while eliminating an attacker’s ability to move laterally throughout the network.
Companies use microsegmentation to both improve protection on individual workloads and improve network observability. When components of a data center or other environments are compromised without microsegmentation, attackers may be allowed to jump from one asset to the next, moving laterally throughout the network. With microsegmentation in place, the attack surface greatly reduces using granular security controls and policy-based security triggers to protect workloads even once attackers penetrate perimeter defenses.
Microsegmentation technology is often used to achieve zero trust security architecture, but should not be confused with zero trust networking software
. While there is some overlap between the two categories, zero trust networking solutions are designed specifically to manage identities and control privileged access to internal applications or computing environments. While microsegmentation technology is also used for application-level security, the tools are more focused on creating secure zones, establishing security policies, and isolating workloads individually.

Companies need identity governance programs to maintain organized records of user information such as personal information, account histories, or application credentials. These confidential records can be used by employees and administrators to retain information and regulations. IT managers and administrators utilize the information in these systems to automate tasks such as account creation, editing, or deleting, which can help facilitate employee lifecycle changes like onboarding, promotions, or termination. Human resource workers may utilize the databases as well to aggregate information about employees and monitor access requests. There is significant overlap between user provisioning software and cloud identity and access management.

Federation is the linking of IT systems, organizations, and personal identities with credentials and repositories. SSO solutions serve to simplify identification processes and create an uninhibited feel when working to access applications, portals, and servers. The software is designed to provide users with access to multiple applications or datasets without requiring multiple logins.
The goal of SSO software is not only to improve ease of use while navigating across applications but also to minimize work for IT administrators and developers by centralizing access management. SSO products effectively join the desired applications and route logins through an SSO server. These solutions often include features such as dashboards for simplified navigation, application clouds, directory integration, and mobile applications for remote access.
There is some crossover between SSO software and solution types such as cloud identity and access management software

Companies use RBA software to increase the effectiveness of user governance and authentication procedures. Users who are determined to be riskier are required to provide additional authentication information. These analyze IP addresses, devices, behaviors and identities to set customized authentication methods for each individual user attempting to access the network. Non-suspicious users accessing applications from known devices, locations, and networks may be automatically signed in. Suspicious users may be required to prompted to provide SMS code, biometric verification, or email confirmation actions to properly verify their identity.

https://www.g2.com/categories/privileged-access-management-pam,Privileged Access Management (PAM) Software,"Privileged access management (PAM) software helps companies protect the “keys to their IT kingdom"" by ensuring the credentials of their privileged accounts, such as admin accounts on critical company assets, are only accessed by those with proper permissions to do so. PAM software helps prevent external hacking or internal misuse of important company assets by employing “least privilege access"" policies, wherein users receive the absolute minimum access needed to perform their duties.
PAM software allows companies to secure their privileged credentials in a centralized, secure vault (a password safe). Additionally, these solutions control who has access to, and therefore who can use, the privileged credentials based on access policies (including user permissions and specific timeframes), often recording or logging user activity while using the credentials. When a user checks out a credential, it stops other users from opening a concurrent session; this means only one person can access the privileged account at one time.
PAM solutions are used in conjunction with identity and access management (IAM) software, which provides authentication of general
user identities; PAM software, however, provides more granular control and visibility of administrative or privileged user
identities. While there is some similarity between the secure vaults within both password managers
and PAM tools, the two software types are quite different. Password managers are designed to protect everyday users’ passwords, while PAM software protects a company’s super users, shared company accounts, and service accounts by offering centralized control, visability, and monitoring of the use of those privileged accounts.

https://www.g2.com/categories/passwordless-authentication,Passwordless Authentication Software,"Passwordless authentication is a type of multi-factor authentication (MFA) that eliminates a password as an authentication type. Instead of using passwords (something the user knows), passwordless authentication relies on authenticating a user via other means, such as something a user has (like a trusted mobile device or a hardware security key) and something that they are (for example, scanning their fingerprint).
The most common use cases for passwordless authentication include either workforce (employee) authentication or customer authentication. Companies use passwordless authentication to improve end user experience, as many people forget or reuse unsecured passwords; reduce security risks to the company stemming from breached passwords; and reduce the cost of maintaining passwords and lifting the burden of password resets on help desk teams.
For a product to be added to the Passwordless Authentication category, the product must authenticate a user via FIDO-compliant authenticator apps, security keys/cards, or similar technology. To be added to this category, a product cannot rely on email or SMS-based authentication as its main form of authentication, as these methods are susceptible to hacks. Similarly, a product cannot merely provide password replay; it must provide a truly passwordless solution. Some products may complement their FIDO-compliant authenticator with biometric authentication. Additionally, products may offer fallback methods including voice, email, or SMS-based authentication, but that should be a feature a company can choose to offer if the end user is offline and does not have access to cellular data or networks when using a mobile device (vs. using a hardware security key).
Depending on the use case, passwordless authentication works with a company’s identity and access management (IAM) software

https://www.g2.com/categories/identity-and-access-management-iam,Identity and Access Management (IAM) Software,"Identity and access management (IAM) software helps companies protect their systems from unauthorized access or misuse by only allowing authenticated, authorized users (typically employees, based on job roles) to access specific, protected company systems and data. IT administrators leverage the software to quickly provision, deprovision, and change user identities and the corresponding user access rights at scale. IAM software authenticates users, provides access to systems and data based on company policies, tracks user activity, and provides reporting tools to ensure employees are in compliance with company policies and regulations.
Many IAM solutions include single sign-on (SSO)

This includes reducing user identity fraud, rapidly onboarding new users, reducing costs associated with provisioning and issuing digital certificates, offering end users a privacy-preserving identity verification method, and reducing security risks associated with centrally storing identity information, including regulated data such as personally identifiable information (PII).
Decentralized identity software is used by companies to validate or manage the identities of employees, customers, other end users, and even devices such as internet of things (IoT) devices. End users, such as customers, benefit from decentralized identity solutions in terms of convenience and privacy. Unlike centralized identity management software
where a company retains PII about the user such as name, email address, passwords, and other identifiers, decentralized identity management allows the end user to maintain direct control over their identity information and easily share or revoke access to that data by the company validating the identity. The concept of an individual having direct control over their digital identity without the use of a centralized registry, identity provider, or certificate authority is called self-sovereign identity (SSI).
Decentralized identity solutions are often built on distributed ledger technology (DLT) systems, such as blockchain software
, which provides validation, improved traceability, and documentation over traditional identity management solutions. End users store their digital identity and other credentials in a verifiable credential wallet application.

Biometric authentication tools utilize physical characteristics (such as facial, fingerprint, or voice recognition) to verify a user’s identity. They are often paired with physical authentication tools or username/password combinations as a secondary level of authentication. As biometric characteristics are much more difficult to mimic, companies leverage these tools to improve the security and effectiveness of authentication processes.
Development, security and IT teams can all use biometric authentication software for different or similar purposes. Development teams may build biometric authentication into mobile or web applications. IT and security teams may use the tools to beef up security and assist with identity management processes. End users may be either internal employees or customers, depending on the use case.
Risk-based authentication software
tools offer a similar solution, but through a different means. RBA can be delivered in a form much like behavioral biometrics, but RBA pairs behaviors with additional factors such as location, device, or IP address. Biometric factors may differ between tools, but typically rely on keystroke dynamics and/or signature analysis for verification. Multi-factor authentication software

In addition to a single authentication factor, such as inputting a username and password, users are prompted to provide a second authentication factor to validate who the user says they are. Examples of authentication factors include one-time passcodes (OTPs) for SMS, email, or phone call, software tokens, hardware tokens, which are commonly small thumb drives or keycards, mobile-push on a software application to a mobile device, biometric factors, and contextual or risk-based authentication.
Businesses use MFA tools for security purposes to confirm a user is who they say they are prior to accessing privileged information or applications. This software can help companies prevent internal theft or data loss, as well as external access from unapproved parties. MFA tools are traditionally used by businesses, but they can also be used by individuals hoping to improve security on their personal devices or online accounts.
Risk-based authentication software

Because of the incredible diversity of IaaS tools, any organization or user within a business could find benefit from the business employing IaaS.
Companies use IaaS for a wide variety of reasons, most commonly including convenience, ease of accessibility, flexible scaling, and reduced operational expenditure (OpEx) costs. The latter two benefits are facilitated by the pay-as-you-go nature of cloud services; with IaaS, businesses only pay for what use, eliminating the large upfront costs typically associated with purchasing infrastructure. Companies also don’t have to worry about infrastructure management, as with IaaS that responsibility falls to the cloud service provider (CSP). IaaS is ultimately used to build or expand business capabilities and can be especially beneficial during times of extreme growth.
Once a business has determined which IaaS tools they’d like to utilize, integration capabilities are the next big considerations, followed by how that infrastructure will be secured. IaaS presents no benefit to a company if it doesn’t integrate with its existing systems, and once it does integrate, the company needs to properly secure any data and transactions that might go through that infrastructure.

These systems serve a variety of energy optimization purposes, ultimately improving the quality, reliability and affordability of electricity.
Stationary battery storage solutions can be used in a variety of applications within the residential, commercial and industrial, and utility segments.
Residential: Residential customers typically use battery storage to reduce their electric bill by shifting grid energy consumption from on-peak to off-peak hours. Battery storage may also make residential solar installations viable in areas without net metering.
Commercial and Industrial: Commercial and industrial customers typically use battery storage to shave their peak energy demand, which typically comes at a premium from the Utility providers. Stored energy is released to keep the demand on the Utility at or below a set point. The storage system recharges either when demand falls below that set point or during off-peak hours.
Utility: Utilities apply battery storage to reduce congestion on transmission and distribution lines and mitigate the need to upgrade them. Independent power producers may also use battery storage to increase the value of an intermittent renewable generation asset, by guaranteeing specific capacity at certain times of the day (‘capacity firming’). Because of their ability to both provide and absorb power in seconds, battery storage solutions have become very valuable to the grid operators, enabling better grid resiliency.

Specifically, these tools deploy analytics dashboards for feedback data that is viewable by stakeholders across an organization. Some products will also provide gamification features or agent-based scoring metrics to incentivize employees to leverage insights offered by the platform.
Experience management solutions can be leveraged for different use cases across a business, including customer experience (CX), B2B account experience, product experience, and market research. Though most offerings specialize in only one use case, some products will target multiple groups of respondents and allow businesses to segment their audiences. Products that specialize in CX collect customer feedback and deploy insights to frontline employees who can execute closed-loop actions based on that feedback. Products designed for B2B account experience collect client feedback and deliver insights to sales or customer success teams. Product experience solutions help product management teams collect and analyze feedback about their customers’ experiences with a product. Finally, market research solutions provide special features like research panels to enable businesses to survey their target audience.

VDRs allow companies to share confidential or proprietary information with an additional party in a controlled setting. A VDR’s robust security features often include encryption, two-factor authentication, and single sign-on controls. The tools enable the hosting of confidential information under strict permissions and manage the viewer’s ability to release the information by limiting the ability to forward, copy, or print the documents.
Digital rights management is a critical aspect of virtual data rooms due to their use during the due diligence process for mergers and acquisitions transactions as well as private equity and venture capital transactions. Additionally, legal firms and real estate professionals use VDRs as a controlled and secure setting for sharing confidential agreements that involve their clients. Besides the granular use cases for specific industries and professions, compliance departments also use VDRs as a hub for sharing sensitive compliance-related files.

https://www.g2.com/categories/ocr,OCR Software,"Optical character recognition (OCR) software, also called document capture, is the technology that is used to convert most kinds of images containing written text into machine-readable text data. Once scanned documents undergo OCR processing, the text can be edited using word processors. OCR software casts a wide net of use cases because of its basic functionality. These tools can be used by virtually any team within an organization, especially accounting, human resources, and data entry teams to glean important information from mass quantities of both paper and digital files. OCR software can greatly reduce time spent on manual entry, minimize critical errors, and improve fraud detection efforts. Certain tools in this category can also make documents searchable and neatly organized for later access by the necessary individuals within the organization.
Traditional OCR software has limited but foundationally powerful functionality. Recently, an enhanced version of OCR technology, called intelligent document processing (IDP) software, has evolved out of OCR’s limitations. G2’s OCR category contains both types of products—pure OCR software and IDP software. Pure OCR software has all the functionality and use cases listed above. IDP software also has all the functionality of OCR software, however, it also utilizes advanced technology such as machine learning software
, natural language processing (NLP) software
, and image recognition software
to intelligently scan documents and continuously improve based on patterns and user behavior. These products also differ from pure OCR software since they are only concerned with the simple scanning of a document, not the parsing of information from it. Because the text extracted using this technology has meaning, this data can be used for downstream processes. Thus, IDP software can be integrated with various applications, systems, and other automation platforms.
OCR software is often considered a hidden technology because it is utilized in so many other software products whose primary purpose is something other than document processing. Many software options, like CRM software
, ERP systems
, accounting software
, and enterprise content management (ECM) software
all utilize OCR technology to increase efficiency.

Businesses can determine what content they want to collect in the knowledge base, how it is used, and who can access or edit the information. The content can range from training documentation to project timelines to meeting notes and action items. Knowledge bases allow users to organize information effectively and offer powerful search capabilities, which help employees find information efficiently and trust that it is accurate. Knowledge bases can be accessed by a large audience, but they are typically managed by a limited number of contributors. Contributors usually include those with more expertise or oversight into particular topics, such as subject matter experts, team leads, and project managers.
Wiki products are also included in this category but differ from knowledge base tools in a few ways. Firstly, the content stored in wikis encompasses a wider range of business topics than a knowledge base, which focuses on products, services, and processes. Further, wikis offer a flexible workspace where employees can work together to flesh out ideas, thus making them more collaborative. Usually, any employee has the freedom to contribute or edit content in a wiki, as opposed to knowledge bases that have a few dedicated contributors and editors who actively manage the content.

Solutions in this space enable organizations to configure incentive programs depending on channel partners’ objectives and size, such as a regional or global incentive program.
CIM solutions provide gamification features to further motivate channel partners to achieve sales goals. Some tools in this category provide rewards and incentives features within the solution, while others integrate with rewards and incentives software
to fulfill programmatic objectives. Channel incentive management software is similar to loyalty management software

https://www.g2.com/categories/visual-configuration,Visual Configuration Software,"Visual configuration software, also known as visual product configurators, shows sales representatives visualizations of custom-configured products with the customer’s selected features represented. The visualizations are tied to predetermined configuration models, allowing only feasible configurations based off of any functional, technical, business, or budgetary limitations. Many tools allow sales reps and customers to add and remove features directly, with the visualization updating to reflect those changes in real time.
With visual configuration software, companies can easily configure, price, and quote products in a collaborative way that is easy to see via 2D and 3D visualizations. Some tools even offer augmented reality and virtual reality functionality, allowing customers to see the product in their environment. Customers and sales reps are able to see a representation of the finished product prior to purchasing, increasing service levels and buyer confidence.
These tools are often used in manufacturing, engineering, and industrial settings. Visualizations can also be embedded in e-commerce
stores to empower customers to take product configuration into their own hands. While some visual configuration products are standalone, most are part of an overall CPQ software
solution.
To qualify for inclusion in the Visual Configuration category, a product must:
Enable the design and visualization of products in 2D and/or 3D
Allow for the addition of features in line with non-visual configuration models
