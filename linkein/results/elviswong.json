Our first two cohorts of 12 startups have already collectively raised an additional $11 million, added 60+ jobs, and have helped well over 25,000 Canadians. These solutions are helping newcomers build credit, temporary foreign workers remit money safely, freelancers access appropriate insurance, employees get earned wages on demand, low-income Canadians start emergency funds, and more. I can't wait to see what the 2022 cohort has in store! \n\nI'm also proud of all the work we've accomplished with the broader Fintech Cadence team including the recent announcement of $400,000 in funding for the newly publicized Fintech Hub program. It was such a pleasure working with the full Fintech Cadence team and thank you for welcoming Molly and me with open arms. On that note, a special shout-out goes to Molly Willats for being a part of this journey from the beginning - I'm incredibly excited and confident that you'll be taking over and can't wait to see how you continue shaping the program and the mission we've talked about so many times. \n\nTo the hundred-plus startups, advisors, partners, and funders that have supported me on this journey, I want to sincerely thank all of you for all the time, advice, and investment you generously provided to support my vision. There are too many of you to shout out here today but I appreciate all the kind notes and emails of everyone that has reached out already. \n\nAs many of you know, this work all started from an initial research question at the MaRS Discovery District Studio Y program - \"How do we use technology to improve financial inclusion in Canada?\" In many ways, that is still the question driving me today and I'm excited to announce that I've decided to join RBC's Sustainability & Enterprise ESG strategy team to focus on topics like financial wellness, affordable housing, and wealth inequality. \n\nI'm still staying in this space so I'm excited to continue working with all of you to move the conversation forward. \n\nElvis",

His contribution to the #fintech ecosystem will be felt for years to come and his work building the IFH Lab has been instrumental in supporting #missiondriven #fintechs across #Canada.\n\nIt is why we are sad to say goodbye to him - within the context of Director of Financial Health - but very excited to see what is next and how he will continue working to build a financial system that truly serves the needs and financial health of vulnerable Canadians! We are also thrilled to continue on the work of the IFH Lab through the leadership of Molly Willats!\n\nThank you for everything you have done for the ecosystem Elvis!",

And now it\u2019s your chance to join the IFH Lab community! The IFH Lab by Fintech Cadence mission has always been to support founders who are tackling the financial challenges, big and small, that are holding millions of Canadians back from achieving financial health and resilience. We also believe that fintech has the potential to address systemic barriers for consumers and communities who are systematically underserved and excluded from accessing mainstream financial products and services for a variety of reasons; like low-wage and gig-workers, seniors, new-immigrants to Canada, indigenous peoples, renters, and small business owners. \n\nWe particularly welcome applications from founders tackling the specific challenges faced by these and other marginalized or excluded groups, and with lived experience of these issues. 2022 brings some exciting updates to the IFH Lab program that we can\u2019t wait to share with you. We\u2019re pleased to be moving back to a hybrid format with some in-person elements that will give our teams the opportunity to learn in-person from each other and our experts.\n\n\u2192 There\u2019s so much more to share but we know you only have time to read so much, so we\u2019ll be holding an info session on March 8th:\u00a0https://lnkd.in/eTVB5pke\n\n\u2192 Apply here:\u00a0https://lnkd.in/eZHGTZHf\u00a0 \n\n#fintech #startups #financialhealth #incubator\n\nElvis Wong Molly Willats Layial El-Hadi Geraldine Holliday Karina Riviello Nina-Mae Proulx-Sylvain, MBA  (she/her) Marina Ticu Athirai Ilangko",

There are knock-on impacts on the physical health, emotional health, productivity and engagement of Canadians and future generations, with more financially vulnerable households being disproportionately impacted by financial vulnerability and financial hardship for those experiencing extreme weather events. Protection, information and access-to-help gaps are evident from the Canadian household perspective.\n\nThis research levers data and analytics from the Institute\u2019s peer-reviewed Financial Resilience Index model and February 2023, June 2022 and June 2021 data, based on a sample size of over 5000 households. \n\nMany thanks to Vancity for their leadership in working with us to investigate this intersection starting back in 2021 and for allowing us to include analytics on their members and British Columbians, published in their 2022 Climate Change Report. This paper also cites and recognizes the excellent research, advocacy, and thought leadership of  Canadian Climate Institute / Institut climatique du Canada.\n\nPlease reach out if you have any questions or comments on this research paper created by our team. And kudos recognition to all leaders and organizations who are working tirelessly to help build a more resilient sustainable world.\n\n#financialresilience #climate #resilience ",

                "Text": "The 7th Index release from the Institute's Financial Resilience Index model highlights the Canada's mean financial resilience score is 51.24 as of February 2023. \n\nThis is similar to the June 2022 Index, which is interesting and somewhat surprising, given the inflationary environment and higher interest rates. Index data shows that Canadians are working hard from a behavioural perspective to maintain or improve their financial resilience, with 70% of Canadians having significantly reduced their non-essential expenses (up significantly from 56% in June 2022), despite 84% reporting that the increase in the cost of living has outpaced any income growth for their household. Disciplined spending and savings behaviours are showing up through very slightly improved household savings rates at the national level, in turn impacting the liquid savings buffer and confidence in the ability to meet short-term savings goal Index indicators. It\u2019s expected that some of the affordability programs (as well as changed behaviours) may also be helping to offset financial stress indicators - and contribute to the slight decrease in \u2018Extremely Vulnerable\u2019 households (from 21% in June 2022 to 18% in February 2023). All told, big picture, financial vulnerability continues to be a mainstream issue affecting 20 million households (or 78% of the population) with financial vulnerability spanning all household income demographics. Those able to exhibit healthy financial behaviours over the longer term have higher financial resilience. But financial stress and financial vulnerability continue to negatively impact the physical health and well-being of many, tracked through the Index since 2017.\n\nWe continue to see nuances in household financial resilience by province and for different populations, with Quebec and B.C. being the most financially resilient provinces as of February 2023. Women continue to have a mean financial resilience score that is 4 points lower than men. Challenges and inequities are exacerbated for  'Extremely Vulnerable' and \u2018Financially Vulnerable\u2019 (with financial resilience scores under 50); renters, mortgage-holders and those struggling with debt; low-income households and single parents; those lacking social capital, impacted by unplanned life events and/or facing systemic barriers. While 37% of Canadians overall have a negative or zero household savings rate as of February 2023, this is the case for 88% of 'Extremely Vulnerable' Canadians with 88% experiencing significant financial hardship compared to just 3% of 'Financially Resilient' households.\n\nMore data and insights will be in the Institute Subscriber Report on April 28th at my TABE presentation to Economists on April 4, 2023.\n\u00a0\nThe February Index is based on 5010 adult Canadians from a representative sample of the population by household income, province, age and gender. The peer-reviewed Index has a pre-pandemic baseline of February 2020. More info is available at: https://lnkd.in/g5A6zcFx\n",

I couldn't be more proud of the velocity and quality our team has been able to consistently maintain.\n\nAll in all, Moves will be the most complete gig worker toolset in the market by 2024.\n\nIn parallel to these huge product changes, we're also making significant strides in how we acquire new members. Although we're still actively experimenting, our go-to-market strategy is really humming right now. \n\nMembers are coming to Moves through a variety of channels, but we're seeing most success from: \n- Organic/SEO web traffic (a massive positive for PMF)\n- Gig economy influencers on YouTube\n- A member referral program\n\nOur team also had the incredible privilege of participating in a unique event called GigCon in Denver Colorado. We spent time with gig workers, YouTubers, policy makers, and partner companies. Moves made a huge splash under the banner of \"Gig Work is Real Work\" - a slogan that so articulately captures our reason for being.\n\nI'm excited for the changes coming in Q4 and incredibly optimistic about 2024 and beyond.",

In thinking about what I could possibly have to say to a group of business and STEM students as someone with a background in neither, I confronted head on the imposter syndrome that has been a near constant companion since I first started working in fintech as a social science nerd with a background in Geography. \n\nBut as I sat with the questions we had been sent to prepare, I realized that I have been at the ground level of a startup. That I have a tremendous amount to be proud of in the work that Elvis Wong and I did building IFH Lab by Fintech Cadence. I realized that through three cohorts of supporting founders in their own journeys, I had a legitimate place on the stage. It was surreal to feel for the first time like I shouldn't be in the audience this time. \n\nThank you to Mirna Henary and the organizing team at Apex for inviting Fintech Cadence to take part, and for the moment of personal and professional reflection to kick off my new year.\n\n#professionalgrowth #techcareers #newyearbetterme ",

Today a group of inspiring Canadian leaders have come together to put their full weight behind strong employee ownership policy in Canada.\n\nIt has been enormously gratifying to see how many people have put up their hands to engage in this effort over the past two years. Not just to say \"hey, this is a great idea\" but to say \"how can I help.\" Today, that help has become very real.\n\nThis group that's now over 60 strong isn't just advocating for any EOT policy. Our Call for Action is insisting on a strong, fulsome policy including tax incentives and a requirement that benefits go to all employees of a company, at no cost to them. This is based on the years of experience from the US and the UK - only with a policy like this will employee ownership in Canada scale quickly and deliver the inclusive wealth it's proven capable of in those countries.\n\nAnything less will be a massive missed opportunity. As baby boomer business owners retire, there are 140,000 Canadian companies employing almost 5 million workers that are the right target size for sale to an EOT. \n\nYou will hear more from me and from the Canadian Employee Ownership Coalition over the next few months in the lead-up to Budget 2023. We look forward to your engagement and always appreciate the support of this community. It certainly feels very real today.\n\n#cdnpoli ",

Without fail, every Monday I start my day with release notes of what our product and engineering teams have put into production for our members. \n\nIn one year, we've gone from being a feature-limited banking product for gig workers to a comprehensive business management dashboard, reward program, best in-class banking product, performant cash advance service, and more.\n\nMoves members can now:\n- Generate annual income reports\n- Summarize expenses by category\n- Label between personal and business use\n- Instantly benefit from emergency cash advances, with multiple options for speed of repayment\n- Earn fractional stock rewards every time they use their Moves account\n- Set weekly earning goals\n- Compare profitability across 20+ apps they might work for daily\n- Instantly fund and withdraw money to/from their account to/from any other debit card\n- Deposit checks on mobile\n\nAnd there's a lot more coming between now and the end of the year. I couldn't be more proud of the velocity and quality our team has been able to consistently maintain.\n\nAll in all, Moves will be the most complete gig worker toolset in the market by 2024.\n\nIn parallel to these huge product changes, we're also making significant strides in how we acquire new members. Although we're still actively experimenting, our go-to-market strategy is really humming right now. \n\nMembers are coming to Moves through a variety of channels, but we're seeing most success from: \n- Organic/SEO web traffic (a massive positive for PMF)\n- Gig economy influencers on YouTube\n- A member referral program\n\nOur team also had the incredible privilege of participating in a unique event called GigCon in Denver Colorado. We spent time with gig workers, YouTubers, policy makers, and partner companies. Moves made a huge splash under the banner of \"Gig Work is Real Work\" - a slogan that so articulately captures our reason for being.\n\nI'm excited for the changes coming in Q4 and incredibly optimistic about 2024 and beyond.",

It\u2019s a role that defies convention. Tactically, this person owns the business success of a venture. This summer I supported my teams in defining business models, mapping markets, and drafting investment cases.

Rolling up my sleeves outside of boards to assist on financial and operational matters, project managing R&D engagements, and helping founders strategize on launching new businesses gave me a strong desire to turn to the operating side to amplify my impact at IEX. Now, I\u2019m excited to take the zero-to-one lessons learned during my time there back to the institutional side of venture to invest in world-changing companies at the earliest stages, alongside the best team I could ask for.\n\nAt Georgian, I gravitated towards \u201cfrontier\u201d technologies from a research, thesis-building and investing perspective, with a specific focus on Applied AI and web3. For the past year and a half, I had the opportunity to build out IEX\u2019s venture arm, and help launch new businesses being built at the bleeding edge of the digital assets landscape. I am forever grateful to Bradley Katsuyama, CEO and co-founder of IEX, as well as my mentor and friend, for his endless support and trust.\n\nGolden is a firm I\u2019ve known by reputation for my entire career. Whenever I talked to friends (Jamie Rosenblatt), founders (Yevgeniy Vahlis), LPs (Ian Carew), or other VCs (Karamdeep Nijjar), several key themes emerged and deeply resonated with me: full-stack founder support, radical candor and unyielding commitment to the craft of investing.\n\nThank you to Matt Golden, Ameet Shah, and the entire Golden family for giving me this incredible opportunity to continue building our franchise.\n\nLastly, my cross-context exposure to frontier technologies has helped me create an overarching framework / thesis focused on sustainable value creation within the Generative AI and Web3 landscapes, and I\u2019m excited to share and continue building on it with colleagues, founders and friends in these spaces. I\u2019ll be publishing a series of blog posts that articulate my vision for sustainable value creation in AI at the application, tooling and infrastructure layers.\n\nTo any emerging / deep tech founders (and VCs) in my network, let\u2019s talk!\n\nCC: Bert Amato, Alison Kaizer, Julia Baird, Emma Cumuric, Mark Lahn",

Like a rollercoaster, the intensity of feeling has run the gamut\u00a0- stomach-turning, eye-closed, blood-pumping fear and excitement.\n\nLucky for me, I've had the great fortune of working with an amazing team (Mark Levitan, Karen Radic, Caitlin Carter, Tanya Romanuk, Joseph Petralito, Sumit Garg), who get up every day and strap in for the ride. Emotional highs, down-turns, and dips - burning the midnight oil has been part & parcel of this entrepreneurial journey. \n\nBut we're winning. Gaining momentum. \n\nWe're doing hard things that not only create impact for our clients, but are changing the status quo. And, despite a very broken market of high interest lenders, payday loans and credit counselling companies, we've created a product that offers our customers hope. \n\nWe like to say that Parachute is a loan with purpose - and for me, it's personal.\u00a0\nI am our client - a kid who 30 years ago (with a commerce degree!) found himself on the other side of a failed business, bad advice, and declaring bankruptcy. A poor financial decision that followed me throughout my career.\u00a0\nBut there's no shame in that - or at least there shouldn't be - and that's why Parachute was created. We offer the\u00a0canopy to help Canadians land on their financial feet. \n\nI want to thank our friends at Intuit for sharing my story with their community. It offers a little background as to\u00a0why\u00a0I do this - and hopefully, it's a little reminder that\u00a0together\u00a0we can get financially well. (www.myparachute.co)",

Thankfully our amazing COO Julia Wilkie stepped in to manage things while I was away, and the team excelled - and I got to keep my finger on the pulse, chatting with Julia regularly and participating in team events like our Dragons\u2019 Den viewing party and our holiday party.\n\nThis time I feel even more confident stepping away for a few months - Julia is taking the reins again, and I can\u2019t think of anyone more well-equipped to run the company while I\u2019m away. We have an incredibly talented leadership team, including our CTO Matt & CRO Dave, and a wider team of 20 people who will move our mission forward. And thankfully we\u2019ve built a flexible, autonomous virtual culture driven by values like empathy and empowerment which supports bringing our full selves to work. I\u2019ve never felt judged for expanding our family (by our investors, our board, our team, or any other stakeholders).\n\nWhen I was preparing for my first mat leave, I spoke to so many other parents in tech who gave me amazing advice. I pulled all of it into a BetaKit article, which I hope has helped other expecting parents pull together their plans. A few of the top pieces of advice based on my leaves:\n- Don\u2019t set a return date before you go!
