This support is going right through where the pipe needs to go. Somebody needs to redesign that.\u201d\n\nSo now the contractor out there trying to build the facility has crews sitting around and waiting for a new design. \n\nWell, the owner \u2014 the city, in this case \u2014 has to make all that communication happen.\n\nOr let\u2019s say the electricians are wiring things together, and the steelworkers up above are grinding away and causing sparks to fall on the electricians down below.\n\nThe electrician is going to come back and say, \u201cHey, we\u2019re not going to work here \u2026 this isn\u2019t safe.\u201d \n\nSo, they clear out.\n\nWell, guess what?\n\nThey were supposed to get that work done today. And so now the utility bears the responsibility of coordinating those contracts.\n\nAll of those things are part of the risks that come along with awarding contracts based on who has the lowest bid, instead of who has the qualifications to be able to take on that risk.\n\nAnd when you\u2019ve got municipal water departments that are down to a handful of people while trying to navigate increasingly complex projects, being able to transfer that risk takes away a lot of pressure.\n\nWhich way makes the most sense for you?\n\nPing us if you need help navigating the risk process.\n",
