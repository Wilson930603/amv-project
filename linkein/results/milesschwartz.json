It wasn\u2019t until we hired an amazing team to build on that initial idea that Z\u016bm became great. \n\nWhen scaling a company, especially in a fully remote environment it is easy to get lost in the day to day challenges and be overly focused on results. I realized early on how important it is to never lose sight of the human element as that is the most special part of the journey.\n\nIt\u2019s been a fun and unique process to self-fund Z\u016bm to nearly 50 team members all throughout a pandemic.\n\nMost of the team has never met face-to-face but the drive to accomplish so much with a minimal amount of capital has been inspiring. We are all motivated by the same mission of merging instant payments and open banking to streamline the entire payment journey.\n\nAt Z\u016bm we understand that everything is better when money moves faster but historically faster money movement meant faster fraud losses. We are tackling this issue by utilizing aggregation data and instantaneous KYC tools to support fast, but secure, transfers.\n\nAlthough this is just the beginning of Z\u016bm\u2019s story, I am extremely grateful for the early success we\u2019re experiencing but even more excited to see what the future has in store for Z\u016bm!\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/ejK6wF9P\n\n#fintech # #banking #canada #openbanking #grateful",

When scaling a startup there are daily fires to burn out, there is constant uncertainty and even when things are going well there\u2019s always paranoia that the success isn\u2019t happening quickly enough.\n\nAlthough entrepreneurship feels like sprinting a marathon, it is important to take a step back at times to reflect.\n\nLast month when Z\u016bm held its offsite activities throughout Canada and Brazil, each team shared pictures from their off-sites. \n\nWhen I saw these pictures it was the first time it dawned on me that Z\u016bm is no longer the concept Marc and I were mapping out at my parent\u2019s kitchen table a few years ago but is now a very legitimate company making a real impact on people all over the world which meant way more to me than I realized.\n\nBelow is the picture of the Z\u016bm team from Brazil during their off site, hopefully on their next offsite I\u2019ll be joining them in Brazil \ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddf7 \n\nIt\u2019s amazes and means the world to me that my entrepreneurial journey in Canada has positively impacted people on the other side of the world and will continue to impact more and more people.\n\nI realize how fortunate I am to be in this position and this change in perspective has made me realize success goes beyond just hitting revenue milestones.\n\nIt\u2019s funny how just a different way of framing something can have such a significant impact on how we view things. \n\nLesson: Change of perspective will elevate your mood and clear your mind: A clear mind, leads to better judgement, leads to better outcome and to the formation of new insights.\n\nMarcel Ferreira Marc Milewski Samoel Nunes Pereira Daniel Souza Renan Zacheo Felipe Lupepic Nathan Ruiz Guilherme Shiba Goto Guilherme Rodrigues Bilar",

But a Linkedin post that took 15 minutes to write made me all of the sudden a \u201cthought leader\u201d\n\nMoral of the story:\n\nWe live in a culture where success alone isn\u2019t enough, optics matter!\u00a0 \n\nAt the end of the day people want to do business with people / brands that they recognize, identify with and trust. \n\nWhich is why it is critical to put yourself out there and create engaging content that is authentically you. This will allow you to stand out since most people are too shy to put themselves out there. \n\n#fintech #business #content #marketing #openbanking #payments",

The truth is this was never the plan. \n\n2.5 years ago when launching Z\u016bm, Marc and I tried pitching investors on our mission to reimagine what a payment looks like by merging real-time payments with real-time fraud detection in a single software.\n\nAll investors did was tell us all the reasons why this would not succeed:\n\n- This was too large and complicated of a problem to tackle\n- We were both first time entrepreneurs\u00a0\n- The barrier to entry in payments is too large\n\nThe list went on and on of why we couldn\u2019t do this, but fortunately this didn\u2019t discourage Marc and I, if anything made us more motivated.\n\nSince then we\u2019ve had great initial traction and have been able to be scale profitably to over 40 employees, have processed over $5 Billion dollars, and are on track to double our revenues over the next quarter.\n\nAlthough there were many lucky breaks along the way, looking back I realize that a lot of Z\u016bm\u2019s luck wasn\u2019t really luck at all, we had a blueprint for success and stuck to it:\n\n-\u00a0We found a problem that was huge and painful\n- We understood the problem more deeply than anyone else\n- We remained irrationally optimistic despite early setbacks\u00a0\n- We assembled a team that\u2019s uniquely qualified to solve that problem\n- We constantly speak with our customers for feedback and continuously evolve\n\nDespite our initial traction, I\u2019ve noticed how much harder it was to get validation from the market by being self funded.\n\nWe live in a business culture where we celebrate companies who are well funded, as if raising money was the desired outcome of the business, as opposed to also celebrating profitable companies who have achieved product market fit and do not require external funding to scale. \n\nHere\u2019s to hoping profitable companies are soon to be the cool kids on the block again\u00a0 \ud83d\ude0e \n\n#fintech #payments #openbanking #funding \n",

            "Post Description": "Unfortunately my time at Binance.US came to an end yesterday as the company continues to right size and navigate through this crypto winter that has been made significantly worse by a confusing and challenging regulatory environment.\n\nDisappointment aside, my time at at Binance.US has been nothing short of amazing. I was part of the Fiat Team and worked on a number of interesting projects during my stint there. More importantly, I had the good fortune to meet some of the smartest and hard-working folks in the crypto space whom I will miss working closely with very much. Thank you Gerry Ho and Tom H for taking a chance on me.  \n\nMy professional journey in the crypto space has been quite the roller coaster ride thus far; but I have learnt so much from both my time at both Newton Crypto and Binance.US. I am looking for a new product role in the crypto space  and would appreciate any connections, advice, or opportunities. Please send me a message or leave a comment below to connect. I am also more than happy to share my experiences with anyone looking to get into the crypto space :) #OpenToWork",

Saw it first hand in the swinging door of talent and turnover in Cannabis.\n\nNow I no longer believe that. I believe that some people are absolutely not replaceable. The speed of learning, the grit, the self awareness, compete level, and ability to get shit done is hard as hell to find.\n\nWhen KIND was in a pinch and needed a specialist with surgical like precision in May, we got lucky and hired Reuben Molot-Toker on a 3 mo contract.\n\nIf it was anyone else, I'm not sure we would have been successful in our endeavor. \n\nBut because we hired the A+ player, plug and play, that I had worked with before, could count on, and knew could take on the task at hand with autonomy and hustle....well that's irreplaceable.\n\nTalent is numero uno. People are no longer replaceable. Lock in your best, otherwise you won't even make the playoffs, let alone compete for the championship.\n\n#talent #turnover #orgbehavior\n\n\n",

After over a year of hard work and *literal* tears - we are excited to announce that we have partnered with Equifax to allow renters across Canada to build credit on their rent payments. \n\nThis hits close to home as it solves a personal pain point I had after coming to Canada as an international student. After about 12 months in the country, I got one of those Capital One flyers about being approved for my first ever credit card - and guess what, it was for a whooping $4000 limit. Being 19 and knowing nothing about credit scores made me think - \"Hell YES, free money\", racking up that amount in cc debt in a matter of two months...\n\nAlso being 19, I had no way of paying this off and I would rather die and tell my eastern European parents that I needed a \"bail out\". It took me 3 years of paying it off and seeing my credit score get to ~500. \n\nBut guess what? I always paid my rent on time. And that never counted to help with credit...I remember thinking back then the system is completely rigged \ud83d\ude05 \n\nThis is true for most Canadians - you pay rent on time every month, repaying thousands in contract obligations (just like with your phone bill) but it never helps. Also most people would always pay rent on time even if they can't afford to pay their cc in full as shelter comes first and foremost. \n\nNot to mention, for 1.5M newcomers coming to Canada by 2025...building credit is becoming harder. Banks are not easily giving out credit cards as it was back in the day, not in this market environment. So qualifying for car loans, mortgages and even an apartment is a real challenge.  \n\nWhich is why it's about time you got the credit you deserve for paying rent. Use Chexy and earn rewards while at it \ud83d\ude1c \n\nI am extremely excited we get to roll out features that make a true impact to million of Canadians and we are not stopping by anytime soon! (psst future landlord features \ud83d\udc40 ) \n\nIf you are thinking \"hell yes\", head over to sign up link before and let's see your credit soar! ",

All of the entrepreneurs I know have had multiple roles and experiences along the way. \n\nMine has certainly been unpredictable and varied. So many things that I didn\u2019t plan for or realize would have value later ended up being useful along the journey in ways I never could have predicted.\n\nA few of my twists and turns:\n\n- I was kicked out of university the first time around. It forced me to re-evaluate what I wanted to do in life (and orient towards business). It also snapped me back to reality because I realized that to accomplish anything, you need focus and hard work. \n\n- While trying to pay my tuition and pay back student loans, I accidentally became a creator, video maker, YouTuber, and teacher through creating my online course teaching the LSAT. Years later, I looked back and realized that this was a turning point for my love of teaching, creating and strengthened my desire to make an impact on someone else\u2019s life. It was an important moment on my entrepreneurship journey.\n\n- I went through a phase of saying yes to almost any opportunity I came across \u2014 whether it was acting, travelling, or public speaking which terrified me and so many more unexpected experiences. Through this, I learned when to say no, when I needed to focus and also picked up a tonne of new skills that I put to use later. \n\nFellow entrepreneurs and creators, I\u2019d love to hear about the defining moments that led to where you are now. \n\n#ThePath #TopVoices #CreatorEconomy #Thinkific #CreatorEducator",

In the whirlwind of professional life, it's important to pause and cherish the relationships that ground us. \ud83c\udf1f\n\nAs I celebrate my wedding anniversary today, I wanted to pause and introduce you to my rock, my confidant, and my partner-in-everything, Keith. While he might not be active on LinkedIn, I know so many of my industry friends and connections are, and I'm thrilled to share a glimpse of our journey with you all.\n\nKeith and I first crossed paths in 2009, igniting an incredible journey together. In 2014, we exchanged vows, promising enduring support through all of life's twists and turns. Then in 2020, amidst the global upheaval, we decided to swoon over each other once again, and renew those vows to each other. (I mean, he looks so cute in a suit... how could I resist). \n\nHe's not just my husband, he's my biggest cheerleader, my sounding board for crazy ideas, and my constant source of encouragement. From patiently listening to my daily work adventures to celebrating every life milestone, he's been by my side, unwavering in his support. \n\n\ud83d\udcbc In the ever-evolving landscape of work, finding equilibrium between professional and personal realms is a constant endeavor for me. Keith excels at this art, showing me the profound importance of this balance. He's taught me that my achievements in the workplace are enriched by the love and strength we cultivate at home.\n\nAs we all gear up for Lend360, I'm excited to share that Mr. Wilson will be joining me this year, sharing his infectious positivity and good vibes. Feel free to say hi and exchange a warm smile if you spot us! \ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffc\n\nIn a world that's constantly moving, let's not forget the connections that truly matter. Here's to love, partnership, and celebrating the extraordinary people who shape our lives. \ud83e\udd0d\n\nThank you for being a part of my journey, both professionally and personally. Here's to many more years of growth, friendship, and shared moments! \ud83d\udc9b ",

The networking opportunities were unparalleled, providing a platform to connect with like-minded professionals, investors, and enthusiasts who share a passion for blockchain's potential to revolutionize industries.\n\nA personal highlight was hearing from pioneers who are driving real-world adoption of blockchain technology across sectors such as finance, supply chain, healthcare, and more.

As the famous saying goes \u201cshoot for the moon, even if you miss, you\u2019ll land among the stars.\u201d \n\nHowever, in my opinion, it can be easier to set yourself up for success starting small to solve a specific problem, as you never know what that can evolve into.\n\n#fintech #usa #payments #openbanking ",
