However, it always amazes me how much the price drops- if you wait, you risk losing out on your size, but I always wait.  I actually paid less for this elsewhere.  That being said- this is lovely and feminine.  The linen is beautiful as are all the details.  Zimmermann really does lovely pieces.  TTS.  I find Zimmermann runs a tad small. I would normally be a 0P or OO but order a 0.  Fits perfectly no matter the item.  Sizing consistency is worth paying a little extra IMO.",True to Size / As Expected

I am transitioning in sizes at the moment (lol), so I tried sizes 0 & 1. Being petite (5'1'') with a short, smaller torso & ever-widening, disproportionate hips...the size 0 fit my upper perfectly. However, due to some health/tummy issues that I have going on, the bottom was so well tailored that it accentuated my immaculately conceived (lol) faux baby bump. This also made the dress length shorter on me, perhaps 4"" above my knees. Meanwhile , the size 1 fit my lower region comfortably, having a lengthening effect so that it fell past my knees. However, the size 1 was completely drowning out my upper & waist, too oversized. I considered having the size 1 tailored via my Nordstrom CC perks. Ultimately, unsure of how long this global pandemic will have businesses closed(especially close-proximity services such as tailoring), I was too afraid to risk it with the cost & the limited return window. sad face emoji.

Sizing: Seems pretty generous, but closer to true-to-size. Perfect for petite, pear shapes. (Reference: I am 5'1'' with a 30DD upper, short torso, very distended abdomen (health issues), & newly disproportionately bodacious hips.)

Fabric tailoring is simple & perfect, as the comfortable, lightweight fabric somehow effortlessly shapes your waistline. The bottom obviously flares out, to accommodate your lower & is quite ample & voluminous. 

Length: It is quite short, as expected perhaps, even on my short frame. I would recommend wearing some spandex, short boy shorts underneath to avert any wardrobe malfunctions.

Value: In my honest opinion, in spite of this romper being beautiful, flattering, & a perfect sampling of the Zimmermann design house, it does seem somewhat overpriced. It is unlined; the lightweight fabric is somewhat see-thru (although the floral print helps to conceal) & seems insubstantial.

I always order up two whole sizes with this designer. I bought the Pearl-colored top in a size 2, and it was the right size. Beautiful and elegant. I lucked out with the last blouse available. 

Shopbop, however, delivered it in such a poor manner. The silk blouse was rolled up in a ball, in a plastic bag, without any care or concern for the material. It arrived needing a visit to the dry cleaners. Awful shipment procedure... not sure why they're failing with packaging and delivery in the last year.

Zimmermann has layered the material and fabricated the suit so that even when wet nothing is revealed. I love skimpy bikinis, but I also love those that have fuller coverage bottoms and bra-like tops. This definitely fits like a bra with good support while the bottoms ride low and are about 75% full coverage in the seat. My only complaint is that this is sold as a set; we are rarely the same size on top as we are on the bottom (5'10, 142lbs, 36DD, athletic). First, I ordered a medium (2): the bottoms fit perfectly, but the top was too small (the cup cuts across demi style) so I returned, reordering a large (3). This size fits on top, but the bottoms sag here and there. Still, it's easier to take away material than add it so the bottoms are going to the tailor.

Over the past few years I have added several pieces from this brand, mostly bikinis and dresses, to my wardrobe and I wear them season after season, impressed by the quality, tailoring and the enduring fabrication. The print is so Springy and the fit very flattering. At 5'10, 142 lbs, I ordered a large; it was very loose *almost* all over, especially in the waist, while the length was a tad longer than midi. Ultimately, it was the bustier top that made this a disappointing return: too tight (I'm 36DD) and too revealing. I know Zimmerman bills the majority of its pieces as ""cover-up,"" but given the price point I wouldn't dare get them wet, let alone with chlorine. I want to wear these pieces out and about.

I loved this dress, but the bustier top fit more like a bikini top attached to a dress and as such, was simply too revealing. And the price point is too high to make this only a resort vacation piece. The floral pattern is so on trend and I truly adored this piece, but I couldn't imagine myself wearing it comfortably without worrying that my breasts would be overexposed if not spilling out with a mere reach for something with my arms. If you're down with this look, I recommend sizing down. I ordered a 3 (large) and it was really loose everywhere, except the chest (5'10, 142 lbs, 36DD).

For starters, it is described as ""unlined"", which made me assume the fabric must be the sort of rich, weighty silk which doesn't need to be lined. In reality, the dress IS lined -- partially. It has a cheap nylon lining which ends at mid-thigh and is very visible through the skirt as the silk itself is quite sheer. This makes the dress look cheap and tacky. Also the lining has a bizarre double seam under the bust which shows though the silk as well.

The pink colour of the dress is beautiful, as are the straps and neckline...if the silk were higher quality OR if the dress was properly and fully lined, it would be gorgeous. As it is, the price of this dress is insane for the low quality. Maybe the black would be better (show the construction less), but in pink it's just awful. ",True to Size / As Expected

The genius of this dress is that the bluebirds flutter when a breeze whips the hem or ruffles into play. Exaggeration, yes, but nevertheless the dress does move wonderfully.

There are button enclosures to ensure that the dress doesn't fly above your rear or fall open at the bustline. The asymmetrical is flattering and the draping is fluid as the fabric swoops around the hip and to the back without adding bulk especially if you are not too curvy.

The orange lining provides enough concealment. Thus transparency is not an issue.

The underwire top gives perfect support with or without the removable neck strap (I ordered a size 1; for reference I am 5'2"", 106, b-cup).  The floral print is just gorgeous and looks great with a tan complexion.  The woven bottom provides a simple yet stunning contrast.  I most certainly will look to Zimmermann for swimwear in the future!  Thanks again SHOPBOP --- Much love!!",True to Size / As Expected

When I received it I was so excited to see that the style and quality are absolutely on par for this bag. It's a little larger than the pictures let on, but the quality is great. The leather is smooth and buttery, the bag is spacious and easy to get in and out of, the strap looks very high quality and NOT cheap like many other cross-body bags, and the gunmetal hardware is smokin'. The only surprise I had was that the ""tooled"" flap isn't a design, it's more like random hammering and ticking. Still looks good though. ",True to Size / As Expected
