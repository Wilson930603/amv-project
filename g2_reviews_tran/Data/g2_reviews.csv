Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.","Ensure that all necessary tasks are completed before entering into a contract with Sage. It is crucial to have the Sage team address your specific system requirements before committing to their services or consider exploring alternative providers.
Customization in Sage is similar to NetSuite, so be prepared to pay a premium and negotiate a favorable contract upfront if their out-of-the-box solution does not meet your needs. It can be surprising that some Sage representatives may not possess a thorough understanding of their own system and may suggest solutions that are not entirely effective. If you engage their Professional Services team, be aware that it may take a week or two to begin working with them, and the quality of their work may range from unsatisfactory to average, at a $250/hr rate.
Unlike Microsoft, where you can find a variety of skilled developers at different price points that can deliver, locating affordable Sage developers can be challenging. The high hourly rates are not the primary concern, but rather the dissatisfaction of paying for partial completion of a task. Unfortunately, the customer success team at Sage may not be very helpful, as they might lack knowledge about their own platform.

The ability to use Excel templates as well as recurring JE's and invoices is very useful. The reporting is strong. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.,"The reporting requirement of setting up account groups is a bit cumbersome and the inability to generate Excel reports that contain formulas in the total fields limits the effectiveness of using the reports for projections and ""what if"" scenarios. When creating reports that expand by a dimension, calculations such as percentage of revenue do not successfully translate to each of the expanded dimensions correctly. Budgeting is a bit cumbersome through SIBP. A big challenge I have is that when I generate general ledger detail and export it to csv or Excel, certain key data elements are not included on each line of data so the utilization of pivot tables is limited. I was hoping that using the csv export option would resolve this issue, but the format is basically the same as the Excel export and appears to be less of a data dump and more of just the same viewable data being presented in Excel. paying invoices with a Credit Card is a good feature but the way these vendor and transactions are tracked through the aging report is challenging. Credit card transactons never really clear properly from the aging. It is possible we are not using Sage properly but we were trained by our Sage consultants on this feature.

Sage has data templates to assist with mass data input, which are helpful. I wish there were templates for every data type, but you can make that happen by exploring their API database and inputting the fields you need into their templates. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.","The very worst problem I had with Sage Intacct was bad customer service. They shove you off to their community site for most troubleshooting. It's an embarrassment how little they even attempt to help you with problems that surely other companies have had before. All my coworkers and I have found the customer service to be worse than Quickbooks.
The other customer service problem has to do with their inflexibility. We signed a contract and promised to have a start date in the future. Unfortunately for us and sneakily for them, they used that signed date as the software start date. So despite the fact that we did not start using the software until later, we have to pay for months of it we did not use. And because this is a repeat software subscription, we are forced to essentially pay them at negative net terms.
Upon multiple emails and meetings with them about it, they told me that's all they can do. When I said, ""Can I just pay it after Net 30 of when it WOULD be due"", they threatened to discontinue service. Yes, that's right. They said they would delete our organization and destroy our books for a NET TERMS DISPUTE where they are in the wrong. So be very wary when signing up for Sage. They will do very little for you, but make sure you give them what they want. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.","It's accounting software. We need to book all our Assets, Liability, Equity, Income and Expenses, like any accounting software. Sage does this fine, but not terrifically. There is no module in the base package for payroll checks. (What? How?) I had to invent a way around this by booking all our payroll checks as journal entry line items.

Another big issue is that you aren't able to make edits to a PO request once it has been submitted. In the early learning phase of using the software, that creates a lot of problems and takes up a lot of time to re-submit a request.

Two report writers come free with the base product: The Financial Report Writer and the Custom Report Writer. These are very limited in scope and formatting. For decent reports, you will need to purchase an additional license for the Interactive Custom Report Writer, or use third-party software.
Data privacy is a big concern. With the ever increasing number of data privacy laws, best practice is to limit the user to information for which they have a business need. Intacct does not provide the kind of security permissions granularity to accomplish this. For example, if you need to give a user permission to a particular thing on one entity, they will have that permission on every company to which they have access, and there is not way to prevent it, other than purchasing multiple licenses for the same employee.

The application that was able to enable the group to create a whole suite of reports for Group reporting for a global business was also easily achieved.

In addition to that I'd like to add that the lack of native VAT/GST reporting really let this product down. Avalara is the preferred 3rd party application to handle this, but adds additional expense. Lack of general ledger detail when drilling down into consolidated reports while only a minor problem, was very annoying. Bank feeds for many banks outside of the United States also lack support. Normally this is not a problem if you can simply import the transactions using a CSV template, but the templates provided by Intacct are hard to use and are difficult to trouble-shoot when there are errors after being uploaded. The base licence cost may prove to be prohibitive for most small to medium sized organizations, as this was ultimately the reason why we decided to change accounting systems.

This allows us the ability to onboard new acquisitions and produce reporting that is comparatively meaningful from day one. The third party plugins are a great way to add features to the overall package. I do wish more (or some) were included in the core product. Perhaps I am wrong but I am not sure if there are any packages that include some of the additional modules at a bundled price. That being said, the core product is great and is intuitive enough for someone with some but not prodigious technical skills to configure and customize to the needs of your organization.
You can also build it out quickly and easily to support new locations and/or entities as your company grows. By using the same chart of accounts, the set up is easy for new entities and you can start with entry and financial statements from day one that are comparative across companies. We are able to manage multiple companies in similar industries within different markets very easily but also have the reporting to compare them in a way that allows us to gain meaningful insight into why certain locations are performing better than others. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.","My biggest dislike is the amount of modules that are not included in the base subscription. I could be wrong but I do not believe there is a tiered subscription model (think good, better, best) that includes more advanced modules in a subscription if you are wiling to spend the money. I am constantly doing evaluations with my account rep and an implementation specialist for a product that I then have to evaluate ROI on. I love our account rep, she is fantastic. It does feel like her job is more sales oriented than support. It sometimes feels like our monthly check ins are more designed to be a sales call which I understand but its also a little frustrating. There are not many things to dislike about Intacct. It is an investment but also one that can help you dramatically improve all cycles in your accounting department. The ability to upload and attach invoices and other documents to entries can completely digitize your AP/AR cycles which is a huge time and space saver. The audit trail becomes much clearer and easier to follow when you can go from a view of the bill entry, to the invoice and find the check # and status of the check in a few clicks. The only drawback is that it is a bit labor intensive to do that. We have augmented that process by utilizing Bill.com but it did come at an additional cost of about $30,000 annually to implement. We are very happy with the integration but wish that were able to do more with the core product in Intacct. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.",We use the stock allocations to make sure that we apportion company expenses properly. We are able to produce 51 unique P&amp;L statements and and group them by common ownership when needed to give partners easy access to progress reports. We use Bill.com as a way to automate our AP cycle and it has dramatically improved our workflow. We can process thousands of invoices every month with one clerk and able to pay everyone in a timely fashion. It allows for a great workflow and approval process. The third party apps and integrations are a great benefit. We are currently evaluating the budgeting module as a way to easily use our actual prior year performance as a way to create a realistic and fact based budget for the coming year. The automated processes we have with Bill.com and hopefully the budgeting module (we are currently evaluating) have and hopefully will represent unmatched efficiency in the AP and budgeting cycles. We are a growing organization and add new entities on a bi-annual basis for the most part. The entity set up process is simple and being able to have a suite of reporting available based on work we've done with our prior entities is a huge time saver and value.

You should be able to put one rate for the credit to A/P and then any other rate you want for the debit to expense. This means that you cannot put an average rate for a debit to expense when it's a service that is expensed at a monthly average, and then put a spot rate for the date of the invoice. The system would then automatically plug to RG(L). I also do not like that when I run a GL detail it will not give me the base currency columns. I have to manually calculate base currency balances. I need to rely on how the balances were originally imported into the system. I need to know what the original base currency balance was and keep track of that month to month, so that I can figure out what the current base currency balance is, so that I know what the monthly unrealized gain and loss is. Accpac handled this really well, so it is disappointing that a newer Sage system isn't on par with an older Sage system in every respect.

It is nice that we can attach instruction documents in specific modules though. The ability to link bank accounts to automatically import bank transactions sounds great, though we haven't been able to set it up yet. Also, the level of possible customization is helpful, but can also be dangerous. Overall, it does what we need it to do. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.","The change to the newer Action UI removed the ability to open or approve purchasing requests or Time &amp; Expense reports from the dashboard, which made the dashboard much less useful. And each update seems to cause bugs that break something else, particularly our customizations. The most recent was the ability to delete attached files in an existing folder. These are generally fixable, but it is a pain to correct bugs after every update.
Also, Manage Views does not show every field, which would be very helpful. For instance, we added a ""permanently declined"" checkbox to help avoid declined requests from being resubmitted (though it's still possible, so this is just a deterrent), but this field can't be added to the approval views to allow us to easily spot these requests and avoid approving them should they be resubmitted. In addition, the Favorites menu, while a good idea, doesn't show where an option is, so there are issues like an option just saying ""approve transactions"" with no identifier of what kind of transactions. The one for T&amp;E says ""approve expenses"", which is much more helpful.
The new bank reconciliations module is also much more difficult to use than the old one if you need to upload transactions. The import process is confusing, and If you have to save and later reopen a reconciliation, you lose the bank tab so you can no longer see and match the transactions. The bank data is still there though, as if you upload again, you have duplicate transactions.

Revaluating FX is also a breeze using Intacct. Our company uses Intacct to integrate to various other software such as MineralTree and Floqast, and these make month-end and AP automation much quicker and easier. Our company also uses Intacct for consolidation and financial reporting. Intacct is able to run detailed reports on the entity level as well as on a consolidated level which are easy to manipulate for our financial reporting. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.","Nuances such as clearing AR or AP sometimes get complicated. When there are multiple different currencies (more than 2) in the same transaction, Intacct has a hard time processing these and we have had to find workarounds by booking to different accounts before clearing the bank or control accounts. There are often legacy issues such as when AR or AP were entered incorrectly (via journal entry instead of using the invoice function in the modules) and then they are hard to get rid of after-the-fact. With multiple currencies, there isn't an easy way to clear old balances related to fx and the revaluation function will always take those small old balances into consideration.

Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.","sometimes syncing issues prevent us from having our aging and payments current. even though we are able to automate our processes, there sometimes are issues in the syncing, which means we have to take time to work backwards and find out what those issues are. also, sometimes we need to find certain reports, or reverse certain payments, but the AR process does not allow for this in intacct. once a payment advance has been applied, we are most times unable to reverse it and have to issue a credit instead.

Integrations with other systems like Expensify, Nexonia, and Sugar CRM is easy to implement and manage. Internal module add-ons like Prepaid Module and Fixed Assets Module makes accounting easier to track and manage.
Custom fields, rules, and reports are by far the best thing about Sage Intacct. Other accounting software limits options but Intacct will allow almost any customization you can think of. Being able to add multiple custom fields to transactions help us track and report more easily. For example, if we have a chargeback, we can copy the original transaction including all of its details to the chargeback transaction. We can then run reports to see the Customer's full picture of invoices, payment, chargebacks, etc. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.","We currently sync expense reports to AP Bills as opposed to Credit Cards in Cash Management. The reason for this is due to the Credit Cards requiring a General Ledger account for each to post to. When employees switched cards, we would have to set up a new GL account for each new card which was far too cumbersome. Since switching to the AP Bills module, this has alleviated the issue.
Another short-coming of Intacct is not being able to report cross-module. For example, the subledgers post in batches to the ledgers, so to see details you must report from the subledgers directly, however if an entry like expense reports posts directly to AP ledger, it wouldn't be in the subledger report. Not being able to combing Purchasing and AP in reports poses an issue when trying to see detail and the full picture. We tried an external reporting program to help mitigate this but the project was far too data sensitive and still didn't get us what we needed. We're able to use the custom reports in Intacct and we find work-arounds. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.","Prior to Sage Intacct, our company struggled with reporting of items per type and location. Intacct's customization allows us to group items by type and location which shows up cleanly on reports.
Expense reports were handled with manual entries which was time consuming, but after implementing Expensify, the two systems sync transactions seamlessly, reducing our monthly effort by at least 50%.
The global search function is also very handy when trying to track down certain transactions that may be in several modules. Instead of searching each individually, you're able to do a global search for an amount which will bring up all posted entries in all modules.
Dashboards have helped save time and manual running of reports for our decision makers in the company. They're able to see real-time sales and monitor marking efforts.
Memorized and scheduled reporting also saves a huge amount of time each month. We no longer have to run reports, the system automatically emails reports to users who need it. We try to automate as much as possible using Intacct and the reporting is by far the most valuable automation for us. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com."

We can delete, edit or undo journal entries, AP checks, bank reconciliations, etc. The main dashboards are very friendly-user and robust. We can star the most used functions in Sage Intacct. For example, if I pay bills, print checks, bank reconciliations, download general ledgers, I can star the tabs. This allows me to spot the most used functions in the system. I also like the different entities we need and it's categorized separately. Sage Intacct have easy search bar on every page, along with different company entities. If one Sage Intacct user need to reset password, the others can assist and reset. When submitting journal entries, others can also edit or delete if needed. It's not necessary for the main user who uploaded the journal entries to edit/delete. This makes the system much for intuitive. There are options to print 1099 in accounts payable. This is really helpful for in-house companies, rather than asking third parties. We can add new accounts in the system and categorized them to expense, revenue, cash, payable accounts. It's very easy to search all the account ledgers, and multiple filters to sort date ranges, period of the year, quarterly months and account range. This definitely makes my work easier to download all reports needed during busy times like audit season, and month end closing.

When printing for AP checks, if we accidentally print on the current date, and realized it should be printed on a different date, we cannot void and return back to the page before. We need to print the current AP check then void and reprint with the different date.

Cloud based is great for remote acces. As we are a global company where travel is frequent, it is imperative to be able to connect from anywhere at anytime.
Easy to connect with additionnal third party software like Nexonia and Invoiced for further automations.
Easy to add users and the pricing model is fair.
Great automation opportunities, especially for companies with a lot of billing and customers.
Easy to create new entities and new sublocations (e.g. divisions) within each entity. That feature is imperative for companies that grow through acquisitions.
Love the custom report wizard feature. It helps to drive new initiatives. For example a customer with 110 locations (e.g. 110 customers in Intacct) wanted a consolidated bill. We were able to create a new summary sales report and a detailed sales report. The customers were happy.

Some functions should be more automated. FX unrealized being one of them. All the software is print out a report that basically tells you what to book but the whole entry has to be manual. Why not just create an entry proposal out of the report?
Bank feeds erase itself and work has to be redone if not fully reconciled. It would be great if bank feeds in Intacct would be working the same way as Xero does.
Deferred revenue reports are not working. It makes it hard and complicated for auditors to audit deferred revenue without a proper waterfall schedule.

Quality reporting: Many times our upper managers inquire about details on the P&amp;L. Intacct allows us to preserve the granularity of the transactional detail directly in the P&amp;L' GLs. Therefore, we start searching in the P&amp;L G&amp;Ls and we can trace all transactions up to transactional documents.
Custom dimensions/fields: we can design new dimensions to allocate and group customers in a relevant and personnalized way to meet our managers desires. It allows us to track sales by strategic groups of customers and detect patterns that allows us to take better business decisions every month.

We have moved from multiple Quickbooks files, and the Intacct interface is like working with software on your local machine.
Intacct does allow multi-entity functionality, though it seems a bit contrived. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.","We have just finished our implementation after a number of months. The process was not great at all. Once the system was configured, we realized that the implementation team had left out some vital information about how the system works, and we essentially had to redesign everything and go live a month later than hoped.
We had three different implementation specialists during the process. It was started with us filling out ""use case templates"" with little explanation and no real relationship to the way our company does business. That process
Now that we are using Intacct for just over a month, I have realized that it lacks some basic essentials. These are truly intuitive aspects that one would expect in a system that promotes itself as one that promotes better efficiency and workflow. Nothing is automated. NOTHING
Intacct cannot import bank transactions,. Each payment made and received must be entered into the system manually and individually. Previously in Quickbooks, I could enter a full month of transactions in a matter of a couple of hours. This is a significantly more burdensome process. I will either have to hire a new accountant or pay for an add-on service to simply get back to the level of productivity we had with Quickbooks!
Our company is a healthcare company with thousands of customers. We receive batch payments from insurance companies, but there is no way in the system to receive payments from one party (insurance company) and apply the payment to another party (the insured customer). The only solution we have been given by sage is to enter a credit memo for the payer and a debit memo for each of the customers in a batch. This is triple the burden that we had in Quickbooks. Again, we probably will need to hire another accountant or two or purchase some third party application to facilitate the payments we receive.
Customers can be set up as parent-subsidiary, but there doesn't seem to be any advantage in doing so, because there is no actual relationship other than the ability to create a custom report that sorts parent and subsidiary. Even that process is so complicated that you need an IT specialist just to write the report.
The only way to import transactions is by journal entry. The problem with this is that Journal entries don't affect AR or AP. So, if you have dozens of payments received and import your bank data by journal, then your AP and AR agings and subledger won't tie to your GL anymore.
Sage seems to over-promis and under-deliver. The sales team eliminated some modules of the system in the sales process in order to make it cheaper than the competition. At this point, we have spent around $60,000 for implementation and the first year. This is a big investment for our company, and we are already having to solve significant problems because of the limitations of the system and create work-arounds.
There may be some limited solutions to these issues, but we have been warned that anything offered by Sage to provide a work-around or solution is going to be very expensive.

Some of the tech-focused aspects such as the fixed assets module and how it's set up to automatically depreciation, but also able to be downloaded as a list. Great! We have hundreds, maybe thousands of assets and that's very much how we need to reconcile - as a list like that. The fact that every screen and every view practically can be exported to CSV/excel (great for accountants). The amazing conventions each year!

The Accounts Payable module has the date of the check showing as the date it's selected - not the date it's printed. This is like a basic Accounting System 101 no-no. Every accounting system in the world and every bookkeeper in the world will tell you that they expect to see the date a check is printed, not the date it's selected. I mean this isn't supplemental stuff - this is a seriously basic, fundamental feature that's core to the everyday workflow of every bookkeeper in the world. Similar core design decisions in the bank recon module and GL reports that makes bookkeepers and accountants scratch their heads. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.","The way the reports are arranged with account groups means that if you set up account groups to be ranges rather specific accounts, you can sometimes capture coding errors more easily. For instance I can immediately flag expenses which might be unusual or incorrectly coded because I set the income statement report to grab a range of accounts, and little did I know an expense went to an account we barely use and never would have predicted. Sometimes this is because an accounts payable clerk wasn't sure about a transaction, which leads to us questioning an unusual expense.
It's helpful that the General Ledger report in Intacct has account ranges as well. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com."

Dimensions are a great idea, but again not user friendly and too difficult to use in many reports - there's always some box we didn't know about in another area that needed to be included. Reporting options seem like they should work great, but take way to long to have to create and figure out.

Training is also difficult for new features that come out. I've tried the webinars before and found that my key questions are ignored. Also, I understand that there are weekly e-mail forums, but honestly no one has time to sit and read through everyone's comments and questions - most of which don't apply to our industry.

- Dimensions
- Configurable and visual dashboards
- Configurable, scheduled emails
- Permissions and contols
- API for pre-configured or custom integrations
- Locked into a small business discount for entirety of the relationship -- 50% discount on some add-on modules or an effective 15% off sticker
- Quickly being able to build out a set of different internal books, like a pro-forma view of what your 2 companies would have looked like financially had they always been 2 companies (not recently split off from 1).
- Great training courses (for an additional fee) and instructors Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.","#1 - Expect to spend a lot of time setting up this system -- both with your implementation partner and after. While the system is quite powerful and configurable, someone has to set it up.
- Support often takes 1 week to ping back basic responses that don't address problem; quick to kick back to you without addressing thoroughly or asking good questions to elicit more information
- Finding community suggestions that are:
-- years old
-- on expected features
-- something support referred you to recommends (as though it's a new idea and no one else has asked for it) when there's no solution
- Small business discount maxing out at 3 users -- heavy increase on subscriptions if we expand by one more business user.
- needing to ask to turn on features that are globally helpful, like audit trail or Collaborate
- Some settings are not granular enough, for example turning off an employee type user's ability to email a PO to a vendor while still providing them with related abilities for internal purposes.
- Configurable emails are limited to customers only. No customization on email to vendors.
- Using merge fields is very tedious and time consuming. If you want to build a cover letter to go with those weekly automated emails, forget it. Apparently there was once a Word plug in that assisted with this -- it's stated to be no longer supported but remains downloadable.
- The additional fee for use of APIs and a sandbox environment -- one of the selling points of the system is that it's ""built to integrate with other systems"" and it's primary function is as the accounting piece. So why not include these features to begin with?
- Other features: Payroll -- We don't use it because it's not offered. Selecting Intacct means you'll need to select a new payroll provider. We opted for ADP to enhance our HR offerings and use this partner's pre-integrated platform to port over weekly payroll activity. This was another big implementation we took on last year. I elected to continue using Quickbooks for payroll the next 2 quarters while we configured this piece after we had Intacct configured.
- Downloading banking activity requires a 3rd party integration, which you'll also need to separately implement with that vendor since Intacct is so highly configurable, mapping to your dimensions isn't standardized.
- There aren't a ton of pre-built reports and building reports, while powerful, is very time consuming. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.","- Better segregation of duties through:
-- different user license levels (mail room supervisor entering digital PO request rather than turning in a paper request)
-- very precise granular permission settings on defined roles
Several features we are not using today will be used at a later time. While we implemented the accounting piece of Intacct last year, this was the first of many pieces that we are still custom developing. The purpose for selecting a more powerful accounting system was so that it could eventually serve as the warehouse of financial transactions, business rules manager of financial transaction and for building reports and dashboards for executive overview.
The real intent of moving into Intacct has yet to be realized:
-- integrating with other systems
-- greater visibility into our financial statements for better, faster decision making
I will absolutely update this review if given the opportunity once we have our custom pieces developed and integrated. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com."

1) Seamless Consolidation of Muti-Entities using multiple currencies.
2) The ability to use dimensions to reduce the size of our chart of accounts.
3) Dashboards for key operating metrics and report distribution for management.
Intacct hit on all three of our requirements in a big way. The consolidation is now prepared with the push of a button whereas in the past with QuickBooks the consolidation was a very manual and time consuming process in excel that generally took about a week to prepare.
Using dimensions, we are able to tag each transaction with key attributes that were important for our end using reporting. The use of dimensions has allowed us to create multiple reports utilizing locations, regions, cost centers etc.
Dashboards have been a great way to eliminate paper reports by creating custom dashboards with key operating metrics for each manager. These dashboards are real-time and allow management to makes decisions with timely, accurate data.
4) Upload templates have also been a huge time saver for input of journal entries and accounts payable bills. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.",I really cant find anything that I dislike in the system. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.,"The benefits of Intacct have been significant.

Now more time can be spent reviewing the data and being able to make timely decisions on accurate data.
The controls around the system prevent transactions from being deleted. There is always a great audit trail. I felt with QuickBooks there were no controls over data input and modifications.
The most important benefit has been being able to produce timely accurate data with the ability to deliver seamless reports and dashboards to senior management so that the business decision makers have timely and accurate data at their fingertips to make smart decisions.

Attaching PDF copies of our bills has allowed us to become paperless and we're saving a lot of time filing papers and then going back and searching for invoices in large filing cabinets.
Another nice thing is that we're able to make updates at the top level and then all of our various companies (entities) are updated. Example- we can add an account number and it will show in all companies. You can also create reports at the top level and create different.
We also love the ability to create bills and cut checks from multiple companies at the same time. We previously had Peachtree and would have had to open each company and enter them separately and print separate checks. Most of our bills are entity level but the few that we have at the top level saves a ton of time.
The help features in Intacct were really helpful when we first started.

Our implementation didn't go nearly as well as hoped. The CPA firm that we worked with struggled with getting our information transferred to Intacct and wasn't able to fully understand our business model so they didn't set us up correctly. It got frustrating for us and things weren't getting done correctly/timely so I ended up doing most of the work. In the end it saved us a lot of money but at the same time was a lot more work.
We set up all of our general ledger accounts to have a department dimension for reporting. After converting all of our accounts over and using this for over a year, we found out we couldn't run reports with the account and department number showing in the same report. Seems simple but was told it would cost tens of thousands of dollars to create this one report for us. If we would have known this from the beginning we never would have added the department dimension as part of our structure.
Another issue we've come across is that the ""dashboard"" is far more basic than we had expected. We were told that if the information was in the system, we could create any report with graphs etc. that we wanted. We've struggled being able to create a dashboard that actually has graphs that meets our needs. The only solution that's been given to us is to have a third party add-on for this type of service. We haven't worked with any yet due to cost and the fact that we just spent a lot of money switching to Intacct but its likely in our future because of the limitations Intacct has with its reporting/dashboards.

It has been an incredible too for our small business and a staple in our day to day operations. I highly recommend this software for any business. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.,One negative is this software can be glitchy at times. It is not often but when it happens it is a little annoying. I also wish that there was a function to calculate things like discounts and service fee by percentages rather than having to do manual calculations to enter.

I came from a company that used a clunky ERP and the versatility of Intacct is very refreshing. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.,I'm a new user (less than two months of experience with Intacct) and I'm having issues with reconciling my company's revenue recognition (through the Order Entry process) to the GL. This may be due to the way my particular company uses Intacct and not limitations of the tool itself so I plan to do more digging after I'm home from Intacct Advantage. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.,The accounting department is trying to keep up with the incredible growth of the company. We're doing a greater number of larger deals across the globe every day and we're trying to find ways to automate a lot of processes that have historically been done manually.

(51-1000 emp.)",Yes,Sage Intacct,5.0,2014-06-17,"""We have had Intacct since March of 2009.""","There are so many reasons why I like Intacct. The ease of use for our employees is probably one of my favorites. We are a growing software company and every new employee gets a sign in to Intacct so that they can enter their time sheets and expenses. Most employees need minimal training and some have logged in and gotten started without training.
Another of my favorites is the dashboards and how easy it is to put a report on one and to make them look professional. We have dashboards for all department heads and even one that is for the typical employee. Now with the latest enhancements getting the most up to date and important info is even easier. The dashboards make me look good to my boss which is a great plus. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.","Dislike seems little harsh, but if I could change something it would be to make Intacct more flexible. What I mean about this is that we are a small private company and some of the GAAP rules that Intacct has in place don't always apply to us and we would like to see more flexibility when it comes to being about to change or reclass entries in all modules.
The other item I would say needs improvement is their Budget system. There are outside systems but I would prefer to use Intacct and it's easy interface to do my budget and reporting. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.",We were using Peachtree previously and had outgrown that product. Intacct gave us the ability to stop relying on spreadsheets to make our revenue recognition entries. This in turn gave us an annual ROI of around $50k because I was on the verge of having to hire someone to keep up with our growing revenue recognition issues. Since 2009 I have not had to add another employee to my department and I attribute that to the use of Intacct and the improvements they have made to their own product.
